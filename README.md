# Reinvent2019Pytorch

Build, Test, and Tune Machine Learning Models with PyTorch

PyTorch is a deep learning framework that is becoming popular especially for rapid prototyping of new models. You can get started easily with PyTorch using Amazon SageMaker, a fully managed service to build, train, and deploy machine learning models at scale. In this workshop, we build a natural language processing model to analyze text.
