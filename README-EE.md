# AIM402 Deep learning with PyTorch

## Build, Test, and Tune Machine Learning Models with PyTorch & Amazon SageMaker

This set of labs aim to enable to develop end-to-end NLP solutions with [PyTorch](pytorch.org) using  [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) 
for the full Machine Learning Lifecycle. Each lab is independent, but during the presentation we would go sequentially. 
We wish to thank the authors and code committers of projects listed in the reference section, the labs would not be possible without this 
excellent material.
