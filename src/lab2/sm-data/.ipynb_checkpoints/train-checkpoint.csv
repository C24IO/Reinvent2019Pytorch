 What is a """"scalar force""""?  

At the start of the current article there appears a list of pointers to other article, and the last item on the list says """"For the scalar force that appears in polar coordinates, see the article on polar coordinates"""". I checked the article on polar coordinates, and the word """"scalar"""" doesn't appear there. So, what exactly IS a """"scalar force""""? And why does the article point to another article for explanation of something that isn't even mentioned in the other article? Surely something is amiss.63.24.61.29  
Of course, you are correct in pointing out the absurdity of a """"scalar"""" force. This pointer should be removed altogether, but I have only edited it to remove the absurdity. The history of this article shows that this pointer was a concession to a long, drawn out battle that apparently exhausted all parties and led to this compromise.   
Any single dimension is a scalar- a scalar is simply a single number. There's nothing absurd about a scalar force any more than there is about a scalar acceleration. What is 9.81 m/s^2?- () WolfKeeper (Talk) 

I don't understand the """"corrected"""" version. The acceleration component that it refers to (i.e., the one that arises in stationary polar coordinates) is explicitly described and given the name """"centrifugal force"""" in countless reputable references, including:

(1) """"An Introduction to the Coriolis Force"""" By Henry M. Stommel, Dennis W. Moore, 1989 Columbia University Press. 
(2) """"Methods of Applied Mathematics"""" By Francis B. Hildebrand, 1992, Dover, p 156.
(3) """"Statistical Mechanics"""" By Donald Allan McQuarrie, 2000, University Science Books. 
(4) """"Essential Mathematical Methods for Physicists"""" By Hans-Jurgen Weber, George Brown Arfken, Academic Press, 2004, p 843.

 This has been pointed out previously, with the relevant quotations. I don't think there can be any dispute of the fact that this particular acceleration term is indeed among the terms that are called (in contemporary reputable sources) centrifugal force. Needless to say, it's entirely a matter of convention as to what names we give certain terms appearing in certain equations, but since Wikipedia articles are supposed to reflect verifiable facts from reputable sources, I can't see any justification for excluding this particular fact from the article. I think any discussion of the contemporary (let alone the historical) concept of centrifugal force is incomplete if it doesn't include this. 

There are also other concepts that go under the name """"centrifugal force"""" but that are not yet mentioned in this article. And conversely, there are lots of things discussed at length in this article that are only indirectly related to the concept of centrifugal force. I understand that much of this material has been added as part of a tutorial on general physics being given to placate some of the editors here, but ultimately I think it detracts from the readibility and relevance of the article. 

Overall I think the present article has evolved into a lengthy set of notes that various people have made as they clarified in their own minds certain aspects and implications of the centrifugal force, as they responded to challenges from certain other editors. Sort of learning on the job. That's a commendable exercise, but it doesn't make for a very coherent article, and frankly, the",0,0,0,0,0,0

Jayjg, is there any edit to this article you would accept? What are your objections to clarifying ethnic vs. religious definitions of """"Jews""""? The article is currently confusing as to which is which, and it would help to clarify that JfJ means ethnic Jews. I think in the case Mackan points out, """"many"""" is appropriately used-many Jewish groups do see JfJ that way, but certainly not all (I would imagine there are plenty of Jewish groups without any official position on JfJ.) Also, most religions are rather fluid and change over time, and there is often debate over interpretation. It is, therefore, not quite so easy to state religious principles as fact (Jews don't believe in Jesus as Messiah? What about Messianic Judaism?) Of course, religious faith also tends to be given over to a lot of dogmatism (""""my way is the correct one"""" type of thinking), so sometimes it's difficult to see debates to that as valid. WP:WEASEL does not object to ever using """"many"""" or """"most"""" or the like as qualifiers, it advocates against it only in the absence of sourcing. What we have here is a lot of sourcing, which does not, however, show that all Jews object to JfJ (as I explained above, that would be effectively impossible). It does, of course, show that """"many"""" do (I wouldn't even object to """"almost all"""" or """"most""""), but in order to preserve the plausibility requirement of WP:NPOV (JfJ's assertion that it is Jewish must be treated as plausible), it is impossible that all Jewish organizations disagree-as JfJ doesn't!

 Edit request on 26 February 2012 

Pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS) is a syndrome in which children have abrupt, dramatic onset of Tourette's Syndrome, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), or anorexia nervosa coincident with the presence of two or more neuropsychiatric symptoms.  It is believed that these children experience a rise in dopamine levels as a result of a of cross-reactive anti-neuronal antibodies triggered by streptococcal or mycoplasma infection.  The cross-reaction is believed to cause such side effects as tics.

  
No.  1.  You are misreading the source.  Tics are hypothetically a feature of PANS, but you've extended that to TS, which misses the whole point of the PANS hypothesis.  PANS is hypothetically posed as a condition in which symptoms are not better explained by another condition such as Tourette's, so your text is wrong.  Second, there is exactly one paper written about PANS, it is a proposal, see WP:RECENTISM, and there is no reason to include speculative text in a Featured article.  If more papers are published, and if PANS gains some widespread medical consensus, and if secondary reviews discuss it, then you might propose accurate text here discussing the situation. I'm a bit concerned that you are editing both PANDAS and PANS, and yet your definition of the hypothetical PANS above does not seem to match the cited source, which discusses abrupt onset of OCD.  Furthermore, PANS is proposed for research purposes until there is more coverage, it doesn't belong in this (an unrelated) article.   (Talk)

 My opinions about PRT reflect the position of mainstream transit advocates in Minnesota such as the Sierra Club North Star Chapter . It is reasonable and moderate to rely on facts instead of conjecture. PRT does not exist in revenue service anywhere in the world. Any claims about PRT are merely conjecture, not fact.  Any comparisons between PRT and other proven modes of transport is meaningless, unless the purpose  is to mislead. What I have successfully proven in print and on the internet is that many PRT advocates use """"facts"""" based on conjecture that PRT can out-perform conventional, existing modes of transport to argue that public funding for transit is wasteful. You can see that for yourself in this video made by a PRT advocate.. One PRT """"fact"""" often repeated by advocates in public meetings is that PRT can pay for itself out of fair-box revenue - you can hear that in this video and this video.

Over time, this leads to mistakes.

Incidentally, the final """"produced by Tiger Television for the ITV network by Thames Television"""" does make sense if you know the context - it means that it was made by a production company called Tiger Television for the London weekday broadcaster Thames TV, who in turn syndicated it to the UK-wide Independent Television (Channel 3) network.

 Scientists Discuss """"Evolution"""" 

“My attempts to demonstrate evolution by an experiment carried on for more than 40 years have completely failed. It is not even possible to make a caricature of an evolution out of paleobiological facts. The idea of an evolution rests on pure belief”. (Nils Heribert Nilsson, noted Swedish botanist and geneticist, of Lund University and evolutionist).

“I think in fifty years, Darwinian evolution will be gone from the science curriculum. I think people will look back on it and ask how anyone could, in their right mind, have believed this, because it's so implausible when you look at the evidence”. (Johnathan Wells, 'Icons of Evolution').

“I have come to the conclusion that Darwinism is not a testable scientific theory, but a metaphysical research program”. (Karl Popper, German born philosopher of science, called by Nobel Prize winner Peter Medawar, 'Incomparably the greatest philosopher of science who has ever lived').

“Scientists who go about teaching that evolution is a fact of life are great con-men, and the story they are telling may be the greatest hoax ever! In explaining evolution we do not have one iota of fact”. (Newton Tahmisian, Atomic Energy Commission).

“The pathetic thing about it is that many scientists are trying to prove the doctrine of evolution, which no science can do”. (Robert A. Milikan, physicist by provision and a Nobel Prize winner, speech before the American Chemical Society).

“The miracles required to make evolution feasible are far greater in number and far harder to believe than the miracle of creation”. (Richard Bliss, former professor of biology and science education as Christian Heritage College, ‘It Takes a Miracle for Evolution).

“The only competing explanation for the order we all see in the biological world is the notion of special creation”. (Colin Patterson, evolutionist and senior Paleontologist at the British Museum of Natural History, which houses more than 60.000.000 fossils).

“Evolution is a fairy tale for grown ups. This theory has helped nothing in the progress of science. It is useless”. (Prof. Louis Bounoure, Director of Research, National Center of Scientific Research).

“All of us who study the origin of life find that the more we look into it, the more we feel it is too complex to have evolved anywhere. We all believe as an article of faith that life evolved from dead matter on this planet. It is just that life’s complexity is so great, it is hard for us to imagine that it did”. (Dr. Harold Urey, Nobel Prize winner).

“A growing number of respectable scientists are defecting from the evolutionist camp, moreover, for the most part these ‘Experts’ have abandoned Darwinism, not on the basis of religious faith or biblical persuasions, but on strictly scientific grounds, and in some instances, regretfully”. (Dr. Wolfgang Smith, physicist and mathematician).

“The evolution theory is purely the product of the imagination”. (Dr. Ambrose Flemming, Pres. Philosophical Society of United Kingdom).

“I have always been slightly suspicious of the theory of evolution because of its ability to account for any property of living beings. I have therefore tried to see whether biological discoveries over the last thirty years or so fit in with Darwin’s theory. I do not think that they do. To my mind, the theory does not stand up at all”. (H. Lipson, “A Physicist Looks at Evolution“, Physic Bulletin, Page 138).

“The talk of evolution is sheer nonsense not founded on observation and wholly unsupported by fact. This Museum is full of proof of the utter falsity of their view”. (Niles Ethredge, British Museum of Science).

“(Evolution is) a great cosmologic myth of the twentieth century”. (Michael Denton, molecular biochemist, ‘Evolution, Theory in Crisis’).

“The evolutionary establishment fears creation science, because evolution itself crumbles when challenged by evidence. In the 1970s and 1980s, hundreds of public debates were arranged between evolutionary scientists and creation scientists. The latter scored resounding victories, with the result that, today, few evolutionists will debate. Isaac Asimov, Stephen Jay Gould, and the late Carl Sagan, while highly critical of creationism, all declined to debate”. (James Perloff, ‘Tornado in a Junkyard’, This book was published in the year 1999, Page 241).

“Evolution is faith, a religion”. (Louis T. More, professor of paleontology at Princeton University).

“Evolution is baseless and quite incredible”. (John Ambrose, ‘The Unleashing of Evolutionary Thought’).

“Darwinism itself has become a religion”. (Norman Macbeth).

“There is no evidence, scientific or otherwise, to support the theory of evolution”. (Cecil Wakely).

5ff461c9078e57cc,"""power versus energy
Good article, very well cited.  [User:Dick Mills]

While very many people confuse the terminology for power and energy, it is particularly embarrassing to do it in an article with such a title.   The Watt is a unit of power, the rate of consumption. Power can not be consumed.  Energy, which can be consumed, is measured in watt-hours or joules. 

The openening sentences which say, """"In 2004, the worldwide energy consumption of the human race was estimated at 15 TW with 86.3% from burning fossil fuels.[1] This is equivalent to 0.5 ZJ (= 1021 J) per year."""" should be changed to """"In 2004, the worldwide energy consumption of the human race was estimated at 0.5 ZJ (=1021 J) with 86.3% from burning fossil fuels.[1]  The average rate of consumption is thus 15 TW.""""   

Similarly, the labels on the the graphs should be changed. 

Unfortunately, the association of consumption with power (watts) continues throughout the article.  Again, """"The energy used to generate 2 TW of electricity is approximately 5 TW, as the efficiency of a typical existing power plant is around 38%."""" is incorrect.  One needs 5 TW of power (not energy) to create 2 TW of power at 38% efficiency. 

Even more unfortunate, I worry that some of the numbers are wrong because of the confusion between power and energy.  For things like wind, where a 100 MW generator operates at only 11% capacity factor, the difference between installed capacity and average production over a long period of time is 9:1.  A dominating factor.  I checked a couple of the references cited, and they too use power and energy inconsistently.  

It will take a major rewrite to correct this article.  Both the nomenclature and the numbers need to be checked.

d5ef9dff36ac058f,"Thanks for your comments. I can understand how debates with people who have a fundamentalist disposition can be very frustrating and in some ways provoke a similar response. I assure I have no axe to grind on this subject. There may be ideas put forward through certain forms of creationism that I simply do not believe because it contradicts the available scientific evidence and I may find certain claims put forward as science exaggerated. It would not stop me reporting those beliefs if they represented a significant number of people or if they had a significant impact in a given society even though they were only held by a minority, albeit influential, section of the community. For example if a country has only small minority of people who believe in a literal six days account of creation yet they have an disproportionate influence on that society, for example in education, politics or the media, then I would cite the best available work(s) I know that support their idea but I would also put in the best arguments against them in a concise summary of the issue with links wherever possible to other articles that examine particular issues in more depth. I approach these kind of articles by imagining that I am an open minded reader who knows little about the subject but would like to see what the main issues are without anybody censoring or filtering out material they personally do not believe in. This imaginary reader likes to form his own opinions based on the best available information with a preference for top down structure in the article, i.e. general outlines of the issue followed by a more detailed exposition. I hope this helps you understand my outlook.  Finally I am sorry for offending you, it certainly was not intended, and if our paths ever cross on the sea be sure to say hello!",0,0,0,0,0,0

 European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) Decision On The 1915 Armenian Event 
This must be added to the article:
On 17 December 2013, (the case: Perinçek v. Switzerland (application no. 27510/08)) European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) punished Switzerland for criminally convicting Mr. Perinçek for publicly challenging the existence of the Armenian genocide. Perinçek said """"Armenian genocide is an international lie"""". ECHR punished Switzerland for violating Perinçek's right of freedom of expression (Article 10). ECHR referenced three decisions on its verdict: 
a. In November 2007, The Spanish Constitutional Court had found unconstitutional the offence of negation and had taken the view that
the mere negation of a crime of genocide did not constitute direct incitement to violence. 
b. In February 2012, the French Constitutional Council had declared unconstitutional a law which made it a criminal offence to deny the existence of the genocides recognised by the law, finding it to be incompatible with freedom of expression and freedom of research. 
c. The United Nations Human Rights Committee had expressed its conviction that “[l]aws that penalize[d] the expression of opinions about historical facts [were] incompatible with the obligations that the Covenant [on Civil and Political Rights] impose[d] on States parties ...” and that the “Covenant [did] not permit general prohibition of expressions of an erroneous opinion or an incorrect interpretation of past events”.ECHR ECHR punished Switzerland for criminally convicting Mr. Perinçek for publicly challenging the existence of the Armenian genocide (Perinçek said """"Armenian genocide is an international lie"""").

I hope now that the researchers can freely and without any fear research what happened in 1915.
Notice that in 2013 ALL Ottoman Empire archieves are open to the researchers and any researcher can freely read ALL the archieves and documents in Turkey.
However, Armenia still does not allow its archieves to be searched and reserached. 212.174.38.3

I posted the following comments on the userpage, but moved them now to this talk page with minor edits:

The following changes are suggested:

 Mark """"Requests for Adminship"""" as historical, and open the new process, """"Sysop Applications.""""
 Replace the standard three RFA questions with the six questions shown below.  
 Question 3 - how the applicant intends to use the sysop tools - is similar to old question 1. 
 Question 4, asking for the applicant's article writing experience, is based on old Question 2. 
 I have removed old question 3 about conflicts with other users.
 Questions 1 and 2 are added to establish minimum criteria.  Only one user (Lustiger.seth) who failed these criteria has become a sysop in the last several years.  Having these criteria on the application should eliminate the need for WP:NOTNOW closes to premature RFAs.
 Questions 5 and 6 are added to establish the candidate's character for honesty.  Why this wasn't done years ago after the Archtransit scandal is hard for me to understand.  Disclosure of material negative information should be expected of all applicants.
 Remove the old system of voting """"support"""", """"oppose"""", or """"neutral"""" with a reason in your vote.  Instead, vote """"support"""" or """"oppose"""" without giving a reason.  Then, if you choose to give a reason, you may comment in the """"Concerns"""" section or on the talk page of the Application.
 This change will reduce the """"pile-on"""" effect of oppose voting.  Normally, in old RFAs, support voters vote without saying much, whereas oppose voters write long comments.  The oppose votes are disorganized insofar as oppose vote number 13 may refer back to oppose votes number 2 and 6.  The cumulative effect of oppose votes with long reasons is to say """"we hate you.""""  
 The new model removes this asymmetry.  You can still oppose, but you can't say more in your oppose vote than a supporter would say in her support vote.  The cumulative effect of bare support and oppose votes is """"some of us like you, and some don't.""""  To the extent that reasons for opposing the candidate need to be explained, the voter can explain in the """"Concerns"""" section.
 No """"neutral"""" votes.  If you don't want to vote, nobody is forcing you.  Neutral votes are pointless.
 We can decide later what a passing score should be.  For now we can allow bureaucrats to use their discretion as they currently do.

The following features will be maintained from the old RFA process:
 Bureaucrats decide the outcome after a 7-day discussion.
 A nominator may praise the candidate.  That is probably the one positive aspect of old RFA that is worth preserving.

Hi, Deb. The user, CJ DUB continues to break Wiki rules by disrespecting others by insulting me. He stated the following, yet again: You are in fact ignorant. He also claims to be an editor """"with experience"""". A serious wiki editor with experience does not speak so ignorantly and disrespectfully about others.

1980 World Series#Trivia

'Nuff said. Or perhaps not. Here's a tidbit from that last WS """"Trivia"""" section linked above:

 According to Tug McGraw, one of the police horses, who lined up in the field during the 9th inning of Game 6, was not """"stadium trained."""" (8th item down the list)

I don't think you can top (or is it bottom?) that for trivia. There's a simple reason that over a quarter of a century of trivia sections (and probably more) have piled up in these World Series articles: Writing well is hard work. It's just too easy to simply drop minutiae onto these pages and file them under """"Trivia"""" and let somebody else do the hard work of integrating them . . . later. 

Part of my motivation for dredging up all those links above is that I've noticed an inconsistency of style and layout, and some confusing or redundant info in all the WS articles going back to 1903. It's like the same car built by different contractors at different times with different materials. I find it a bit troubling because it's a sign of limited effort, limited means for anybody to have developed a plan for what could be a real highlight of WP (can you say """"Fall Classic Portal""""?). I found it fairly easy to take the '06 trivia about La Russa and Leyland and create a separate section under the """"Background"""" section, and it seems to have held up since Friday night. But it took some time to sift through it and move the info.

Cutting to the chase: All this WS """"Trivia"""" is classifiable. The better it's organized, the less it will seem like trivia, so if a handful of """"labels"""" could be cooked up for categories of info formerly known as trivia, the overall style of these articles will seem to read better. That ought to settle the trivia issue.

Postscript: For instance, a 4-1 WS where one contender splits """"on the road"""" and then comes home and sweeps to win 3 more and clinch is fairly rare from what I've looked up so far. What the Cards have done against Detroit in 2006 matches what NY (NL) accomplished in 1969 (except the Mets dropped Game 1 instead of 2 to Baltimore). I'm still working my way thru past Fall Classics to see when else this happened, so I can add this info to the '06 article in an appropriate place, but not as an addition to the dreaded Trivia section. A heading that might be appropriate for this info each and every year: Long series, short series. 4 or 5 games would classified as a short series, 6 or 7 classified as long. Easy to spot trends in this area and develop copy to fill a section like this. Was a short or long series predicted each year; by who; was a trend broken, were the prognosticators wrong, did a noted BB writer point this out so it doesn't smack of the dreaded Original Research?

About your comments:
01. They had 11 events in 2011 and 10 in 2012. Why would you revise that number upwards? Ten seems to be a good number for a serious organization. JF is the largest organization in Brazil.
02. Jungle Fight had exactly five title fights in 2012. Two in JF 47, two in JF 37, one in JC 36.
03. Their events are shown on ESPN outside Brazil since JF 20. In Brazil, their events started to be shown before that.
04. About their number of fighters, it's better if you keep the rules simple. For example, require that at least 50 fighters fought in the organization in the span of a year. What do you think about that?

I know it seems weird for Jungle Fight to have the same or more points than Strikeforce, but we have other options instead of gaming the system against Jungle Fight. The current way to determine what is a top or second tier organization puts full weight on the rankings, while your system gives minimal weight to it. I think we should find a middle ground, while at the same time keep things as simple as possible. In order to do so, I would scrap criteria 3 and 8, and use a criteria based on rankings determined by Fight Matrix. That criteria could amount to 1/3 or 1/2 of all possible points. The advantages would be that the main organizations would certainly be ahead of other, while at the same time event short lived but notable organizations would have a high score. By using Fight Matrix, we would be able to easily determine how many points defunct organizations would have. Maybe we could present such a system as a possible substitute to the current way we use to determine notability?",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Idea for Talmud articles 

Hi Avraham: I am reposting the following request from User  on my user talk page for wider notification:

I was thinking of trying to stimulate development of a series of articles on Gemara concepts and doctrines, maybe to help children or newcomers to Gemara with explanations of some fundamental concepts that recur throughout the Gemara. Some examples might be articles on Yiush, Chazakah, Ta'aninun (as in """"Ta'aninun L'Yoresh""""), Eidim Zomemin (forgive my awful transliterations), Migu, etc., etc. Maybe we could even create a category or subcategory for it. I created Breira in this vein. As I don't have the experience or expertise in Wikipedia to know what to do to best develop this idea, I figured I'd come to you for your opinions on: (1) whether it's a good idea; and (2) How to best go about implementing it. Thanks

 Chick Flick 
I disagree with the definition of """"Chick Flick"""" and have issue with it, partly of personal definition and somewhat justifiably as it is uncited. """"Chick Flick"""" is not simply about the popularity with women but with women as a target audience and not necessary a """"romance"""" or have romance as a main theme (learned in school, looking for reference). Just think of the more recent """"chick flicks"""" like Boys on the Side (arguably about failing romance but the uniting theme is their friendship), Thelma and Louise (again, female """"partners in crime""""), Riding in Cars With Boys (despite the title, the larger theme is her relationship with her father and her son, not just her boyfriend/husband), and The Women (female friendships where only one friend is truly affected by her -lack of- romantic relationship with her husband).

I have posted nothing on the article page as this would presumably be a Conflict of Interest, and have made here suggestions of the way in which the book may be used only because requested - my view remains that it should be done by an editor who does not have COI. I think that now we've moved on from the efforts to exclude a source through (wrong) application of the Notability guidelines we're left with Neutrality of Point of View as the main issue. Wikipedia reports what is out there and a decision to exclude entirely from an article an appropriate source which has a view on much that is in the article (as well as topics the article excludes) appears to be a bias. The idea that the only book of lit crit on Beedle the Bard has nothing whatsoever to add to an encyclopaedia article on the topic is incredible. I don't think COIN is central to the issue as it now stands; rather the central issue is NPV. I think there are wider issues which it would be interesting to discuss - for example had my username not been essentially my real name a post on the talk page a year ago saying """"hi guys, this book exists and has something to say about the article"""" would not have generated this negative discussion.

 Examples of errors in this version 

These are examples, not a comprehensive list. While typing it I had the very off-putting feeling that I had already done this several times, evidenced here. It hasn't worked with you, you're still unreasaonble, but I do it anyway for emphasis, and for the benefit of others. 

 """"The term """"Arabic numerals"""" is actually a misnomer""""
 This smacks of political revisionism of the worst kind; what is known in English as the Arabic Numerals are the Arabic Western Numerals, not even the Arabic Eastern Numerals. Yes, they are derived from ancient Indian numerals but nonetheless they are the Arabic Numerals. Look here, the norm is that when people in English say Arabic Numerals they are referring to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, those are the Arabic (Western) Numerals, they are not referring to १, २, ३, ४, ५, ६, ७, ८, ९, and other varities of Indian numerals, modern or ancient. They are known in English as the Arabic Numerals, that's a fact, I will not accept a revisionist statement that counters a fact so early on in the text the article, the article must start with the factual. I'll accept it under a revisionism section much later on, but it must be balanced there with opinions counter to it (counter to the counterfactual). 

 """"... what are known in English as """"Arabic numerals"""" were neither invented nor widely used by the Arabs."""", """"In the Arab World—until modern times—the Arabic numeral system was used only by mathematicians. Muslim scientists used the Babylonian numeral system, and merchants used a numeral system similar to the Greek numeral system and the Hebrew numeral system. Therefore, it was not until Fibonacci that the Arabic numeral system was used by a large population.""""
 What reliable sources do you have that they were not widely used by the Arabs? Why don't you cite reliable sources? Here's evidence that they were  The numerals though were already in wide use throughout the Arab empire, as Avicenna who was born in 980 tells in his autobiography that he learnt them, as a child, from a humble vegetable seller. He also tells that when his father, in Bukhara, was visited by scholars from Egypt in 997, including Abu Abdullah al-Natili, they taught him more about them. J J O'Connor and E F Robertson point out: He also tells of being taught Indian calculation and algebra by a seller of vegetables. All this shows that by the beginning of the eleventh century calculation with the Indian symbols was fairly widespread and, quite significantly, was known to a vegetable trader.

 """"The first inscriptions using 0 in India have been traced to approximately 200 CE.""""
 Why don't you cite reliable sources?! Here, I'll cite some: According to Professor EF Robertson and DR JJ O'Connor, """"The first record of the Indian use of zero which is dated and agreed by all to be genuine was written in 876"""" on the Gwalior tablet stone. This is also verified by Professor Lam Lay Yong, an an Effective Member of the International Academy of the History of Science """"the earliest appearance in India of a symbol for zero in the Hindu-Arabic numeral system is found in an inscription at Gwalior which is dated 870 AD"""". According to Menninger (p. 400): """"This long journey begins with the Indian inscription which contains the earliest true zero known thus far (Fig. 226). This famous text, inscribed on the wall of a small temple in the vicinity of Gvalior (near Lashkar in Central India) first gives the date 933 (A.D. 870 in our reckoning) in words and in Brahmi numerals. Then it goes on to list four gifts to a temple, including a tract of land """"270 royal hastas long and 187 wide, for a flower-garden."""" Here, in the number 270 the zero first appears as a small circle (fourth line in the Figure); in the twentieth line of the inscription it appears once more in the expression """"50 wreaths of flowers"""" which the gardeners promise to give in perpetuity to honor the divinity."""" The Encyclopaedia Britannica says, """"Hindu literature gives evidence that the zero may have been known before the birth of Christ, but no inscription has been found with such a symbol before the 9th century."""" I'll accept mention prior to the Gwalior tablet, in fact, the article needs it and I'm planning on doing it once I'm no longer distracted by your nonsense, but such mention must be well-phrased so as not to mislead and contradict scientific consensus, and the phrasing must be limited to the exact intent of verifiable and reliable sources.

Speedy deletion of Emi Kagawa
 A tag has been placed on Emi Kagawa requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.

f290884e72efefe6,"This is a follow-up criticism of Gwen Gale's improper deletion of the Alex Jones criticism section. I have tried to have this discussed in a responsible way on her Talk page but she has outrageously deleted all the critiques I have posted there. In my view, Gwen Gale's actions and judgement are seriously called into question by her conduct apparent in this thread and subsequent attempts to discuss it. I will post the text of the complaint I made below. If you agree that she has acted improperly, please respond saying so. Two people of this opinion (one other) are required before a Request for Comment on her actions can be made.

This is a complaint relating to the conduct of Administrator Gwen Gale with specific reference to her summary deletion of the section labelled “Criticism” in the Alex Jones Talk Show Host page on 15 March 2009.

Her most substantive comments relating to the summary deletion were as follows  
“single source cited says it's not clear what even happened”
I've removed it following WP:BLP and WP:WEIGHT, given the single cited source says it's not even clear what happened, it's nothing but a non-notable, second-hand anecdote about what may or may not have been a parking lot brawl. Gwen Gale (talk) 
The grounds (as you put it) are WP:BLP. Gwen Gale (talk)  

The complaint is based on five points 
1/ Gwen Gale failed to follow proper policy with regard to deleting biographical material on living persons, viz. discussing it beforehand. The section had existed for some time, had been discussed and commented on extensively, and had been edited by several persons. As far as I am aware, Gwen Gale had no prior involvement in the page or the section concerned. Certainly, I had never seen her name in any of the page history. Unless it constituted a grave breach of some other policy, which not even Gwen Gale has claimed, any possible deletion should have been discussed beforehand and not executed summarily. To quote the BLP policy  “Biographical material about a living individual that is not compliant with this policy should be improved and rectified; if this is not possible, then it should be removed.”
No complaint about the nature of the material was made beforehand; no opportunity for improvement or rectification was offered. 
2/ Having failed to discuss it properly beforehand, Gwen Gale also failed to discuss it properly afterwards. She made a few general remarks, using terms which, as will be discussed later, do not form part of any Wikipedia policy, viz. “single sourced, anecdotal”, and breezily referred those who wanted to discuss the matter with her to general Wikipedia policy documents, such as Biography of Living Persons or Verifiability. As will be shown in what follows the text did not violate either of these policy documents. Gwen Gale refused multiple specific requests to quote the exact passages of the Biography on Living Persons or Verifiability policies which she claimed had been violated. This refusal to properly discuss a summary deletion is against Wikipedia conduct guidelines and not acceptable behaviour in an Administator.
3/ Gwen Gale’s comments on the summary deletion reveal that she does not understand the core Wikipedia policy on reliable sources.
4/ Gwen Gale’s comments indicate that she does not understand the proper scope of Wikipedia’s policy on Verifiability.
5/ Gwen Gale’s comments reveal that she does not understand Wikipedia’s Biography on Living Persons policy. 
The only serious grounds on which deletion of the deleted text could be justified is Weight. This is not the ground on which Gwen Gale chose to defend it. She repeatedly cited BLP and V as the core defence of her actions, demonstrating that her judgement is massively flawed and that her administrative powers should be revoked. The core issue here is not the content. The core issue is Gwen Gale’s conduct and judgement. The Weight issue will, however, be discussed at the end.

Gwen Gale’s Misunderstanding of the Wikipedia’s Guidelines on Reliable Sourcing
It is clear that Gwen Gale does not understand Wikipedia’s policy on sourcing. In stating that the claims embodied in the deleted text were “anecdotal”, she is effectively second-guessing the judgement of the original reliable source, viz. The Austin Chronicle. She is implicitly expressing the view that the Austin Chronicle’s assembled journalists, editors, sub-editors and lawyers made an error in judgement in publishing the article in the first place. This is completely unacceptable and represents a FUNDAMENTAL ERROR IN JUDGEMENT. It is in no way appropriate for Wikipedia editors to make their own subjective judgements about the editorial standards of highly reputable and professional publications. It is the equivalent of an editor disputing a reference to a professional academic journal on",0,0,0,0,0,0

 """"boolean"""" or """"Boolean"""" 

I believe that the spelling of """"boolean"""" should be standardized to be de-capitalized when used in a sentence.  Example: Boolean algebra simplifies circuits.

In the past there was no such nation as """"Germany"""". It consisted of literally hundreds of states, some kingdoms, some duchies, some simply a city. Over the centuries these states fought against each other, allied with each other, and even absorbed each other. Each state was a proper country, and so such names as """"Brandenburg"""", """"Saxony"""", """"Hanover"""" etc defined national groupsm and cultures. It wasn't until 1871 that Gertmany became one country, and even then some regions(eg Austria) weren't invluded. Since 1871 terms like """"Hanoverian"""" and """"Bavarian"""" no longer refer to national identities because they're all just """"German"""" or """"Deutsch"""". However, if a foreign non-German people were to suddenly use the name of say 'Bavaria' as their national identity, and call their non-German language and culture """"Bavarian"""" ALL Germans would take offense to it. This is something of a no-brainer. In exactly the same way, there used to be literally hundreds of separate Greek nations, varying greatly in size, power, culture, and other things. They fought both with and against eaxh other. Today however there is a single Greek state which does not include all the historical Greek lands. However if a foreign non-Greek people were to try and appropriate a regional name that is indisputably Greek(like with Nacedonia) it will understandably anger ALL Greeks. Because Macedonia was one of those hundreds of Greek regional states. What's more today more than 80 per cent of Macedon proper is within the Greek boundaries, and not FYROM's boundaries. So thus FYROM has no legitimate claim to use the name """"Macedonia"""", except to describe its southern regions like Bitola and Ochrid(sp?) in a historical context....... Kurt Stein""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Addressing Crusio's comment, there are markers that could be looked for. for example is the PCSK9 allele, this is all in the context that certain races are more susceptible to certain diseases. Certain races also respond differently to medications. Certain allels are prevalent in only certain races (although there is race mixing as immigration and such, the alleles are still passed on)

I'm sure you all know I'm alluding to NitroMed's BiDil.

In this case, BiDil seems to help heart failure in african americans more then other races. Should we not research into this? 

Would it be racist to give african americans (in the article, they were """"self identified black patients"""") this medicine?

I think a lot of the stigma around nazi's and eugenics and racism has halted the academic freedom into research into this matter. People needs to understand that as an academic, one must have an academic view on things. If a particular drug helps a particular race, then why not use it? But we can't CHOOSE what results produces, we must accept them in order to change. ie. If a particular gene/allele is present in one race that's lacking in others, I must ACKNOWLEDGE the difference in order to help develop methods to create possible genetic cures.

To turn a blind eye to this is not only limiting academic freedom, but is an injustice to humanity as a whole. An example is seen in the case of Lysenkoism, which caused famines that killed millions.

The premiership came down to the last match between West Perth and Rovers (not really a grand final, as it was still part of the regular fixtures), which resulted in a draw, 4.10 (WP) to 4.7 (R) – I'm guessing behinds weren't counted at this stage. Also, I think this comment pretty much confirms it: """"Fremantle supporters will feel very sore at not having any interest in the final match for the premiership. Really they have themselves to blame for the school-boyish behavior they have shown in ignoring the Association.""""

 Deletion of section on Possibility of Mars having enough water to support life 

I'd like to point out that BatteryIncluded has deleted this section. I won't try to argue with him because I have had a fruitless argument on the """"life on Mars"""" page on this very topic. He is convinced that the cosmic ray arguments that make dormant life impossible over hundreds of thousands of years periods in the surface of Mars also make it impossible for life to survive even if reproducing every year (although cosmic radiation levels on the surface are comparable to the interior of the ISS). I gave up arguing the point with him.

However I'd like to point out that there has been a major conference earlier this year in February (with 38 scientists presenting the results of their researches) [The Present-Day Habitability of Mars 2013 - Program]

You can watch the video presentations and decide for yourself if the current prevailing scientific opinion is that the surface of Mars is potentially habitable or uninhabitable. It is true that before the Phoenix lander possible salty brine observations in 2008 the prevailing view was that life on the surface of Mars is impossible. But that is no longer the consensus and it would be hard to find a single researcher in the field who holds that opinion today. I have put a copy of the section into my user space as I frequently use it for reference and found it a useful resource. Please note I did not write this section myself, only added a couple of sentences to it.

Also, the article includes vicious and superfluous references to the stalking charges that are set for dismissal and is quite unbalanced. The following would be a much better text:

Biography
Mees graduated in Economy and Law at University of Groningen. From 1992 to 1998, Mees worked for the Dutch Treasury in The Hague. From 1998 to 2000 Mees worked as a national expert for the European Commission in Brussels.[5] In 2000 she emigrated to the USA, where she changed her surname to Mees.[6] Mees lives in Brooklyn, New York.[2]
Mees' breakthrough as an opinion writer in the Netherlands came in 2006 when she wrote The time is long overdue that women should go to work.[8] That same year, she co-founded Women on Top, an organization that until 2011 advocated more women in top jobs.[9] 
From 2006 to 2010 Mees wrote a bi-weekly column in NRC Handelsblad, and from 2012 to 2013 for Het Financieele Dagblad.

Anyways, regarding about the 2000 New Flyer C40HF buses (5000-5222) they were at divisions 3, 5, 7 and 18. Although, a few of them were at SGV-3 division, when they were brand new and entering into service in the early 2000s, before being sent to divisions SB-5 and WSC-7. If you haven't noticed, a few of their cousins C40LF buses were at the same division they were, since one 5300 series bus was on line 180 in the early 2000s, when it was brand new. So, it wasn't the C40HFs that were at D3, their cousins were, too. 

Yeah, SB-5 division did have a few of the New Flyer D40LF buses (3000-3019) at one time, before they were sent to WSC-6 for almost their whole life, before 3 or 4 units were sent to Veolia Transportation (a bus contractor) in 2009 or 2010. I remembered riding one of those D40LF buses on line 115, when SB-5 used to operate that line, shared by SB-18,  which currently owns the line.

Krishnendu das aka Babukishan comes from an old and very traditional Baul folklore family. His grandfather, Guru Shri Nabani Das Baul, was a much celebrated singer and poet that was instrumental in bringing the Baul culture to fame with the respected and admired status it enjoys today. Nabani Das Baul often collaborated with the writer of India's National Anthem, a great poet, and winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1913, Rabindranath Tagore. In popularizing the music of the Baul. 

Nabani Das Baul opened the doors for his people to the world. In keeping with this tradition. Babukishan's father, Samrat Purna Das Baul, a modern, popular legend among the Bauls, opened up the doors even further by collaborating and jamming in live performances with the top Western and European acts of the 20th century. Babu is a music designer, singer, and author renowned in India for his work in both the recording and film industries. He plays a variety of music combining new age, and world fusion, with traditional folk music in authentic Bengali Baul style
Babukishan began his career as a performer by accompanying and studying the arts with his father, Purna das Baul. He also participated in numerous youth folk festivals, traveling to places such as Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Bangkok, Great Britain, all of Europe, the United States, and Canada. He played with both the Asian Performing Arts Festival at the Royal Albert Hall in London and the Worldwide Youth Festival in Carnegie Hall in New York.

From this beginning, he traveled most of the world from 1980 to 2000 as a composer, music instructor,musician. and singer.

Babukishan, deeply inspired by his Father and Grandfather, knew at an early age he too wished to compose and perform. He began on the soil of Bengal but clearly he was destined to belong to the world of music. His journey started in early childhood when he joined his mother, Manju Das, and his father, Puma Das, playing and singing Baul music in global festivals. Despite the many world tours, Babu also found the time to study Indian philosophy and Folk music at the University of Kolkata where he eventually secured both his BA and Masters degrees. 

So it was that his formal professional career in music began with his family. He toured with Bob Dylan's The Band East & West tour in 1985. In addition, Babukishan has performed with other international artists such as Alice Cooper, Rolling Stones,Tom Petty, Miles Davis, Allan Fakir, George Harrison, Herbie Mann, Third World, Robbie Robertson, Garth Hudson and many others. 

Though the subsequent years, Babu put this solid foundation in music to good use by composing and performing in all areas of India's entertainment industry as well as in a variety of venues worldwide. Then, in keeping with his early dreams of a unique style of his own, he turned to the music of the western world that he had become so familiar with in his early years of performance. His use of Baul & Indian rhythms combined with the Reggae produced his own brand of World Music-Babu's New Age, Bengali Folk Fusion is the result. 

Babukishan has also worked with top Indian musicians/singers and music directors such as R.D.Burman, Ravi Shankar, Sultan Khan and Zakir Hussain. 

As a composer, Babukishan has written the music for several albums, TV serials and films, earning a good reputation as one of the most promising composer in the Bollywood (Indian cinema) music & film industry of India. In his recordings, Babukishan features folk music, romantic songs, pop songs, ghazals, Qawwali music, new age, fusion, Sufi music and bhajans (devotional/spiritual songs). He is the first singer and music composer from the rich Baul family tradition to venture into fusion music by combining Baul/Sufi music with western music and reggae music. Babukishan produced and directed two documentary films about folk music and he wrote a book titled The Bauls of Bengal. One of Babukishan's latest projects is the band """"Birds"""", which he founded. It combines new age, world music/traditional folk and fusion music. His album Soulmate"""" (Universal/Music India) creates a unique new generation music worldwide.and his latest album, Birds & soul mind & body are based on Baul/Sufi music.""""GYPSYINDIA"""" is authentic traditional baul & sufi music written/composed and all the instruments played by him.this album recored at woodstock,newyork during his tour on 2004.

 Your edits to Washington, D.C. 

Hi. Thank you for the good faith improvements made to Washington, D.C.. However, the changes have been mostly reverted for the following reasons:
All new information must have sources that correspond with WP:CITE.
Per WP:SUMMARY, the main article on Washington, D.C. provides only a summary of information and does not go into very many specifics, unless it is considered to be a """"major"""" aspect of the city. Since hurricanes and noreasters are rare, they are only mentioned in passing. In our efforts to maintain Washington D.C.'s Featured Article status, the editors typically revert edits that would expand the information beyond what is required by WP:SUMMARY. Along these lines, storms that have hit D.C. are not mentioned because A) there is already a subpage on the subject (List of Maryland and Washington, D.C. hurricanes (1980–present)) and B) since we can't mention every storm, we mention none of them. It is also the reason """"noreasters"""" aren't defined in detail, because there is already an article devoted to them, which users can read to find more information.
The article is on Washington, D.C. itself, not the surrounding area. Therefore, any information about what happens in the suburbs or the nearby coastal areas is not included in this article.

Early life

Hanssen was born in Chicago, Illinois, to a family of mixed Danish-Polish and German descent. His father, a Chicago police officer, was emotionally abusive to Hanssen during his childhood.[7] Once, for no known reason, Howard Hanssen arranged for his son to fail a driver's test. In later life, Robert Hanssen speculated that his father had done this in order to 'toughen him up'. The elder Hanssen constantly disparaged his son and said that Robert would never make anything of his life.[8]

Hanssen graduated from William Howard Taft High School in 1962 and went on to attend Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois, where he earned a bachelor's degree in chemistry in 1966. While at Knox, he took an interest in Russian through elective courses. It was also at this time when Hanssen applied for a cryptographer position in the NSA but was rebuffed due to budget setbacks. Originally set to become a doctor, Hanssen took the opportunity to enroll in the dental school at Northwestern University.[9] He did well academically, but said that he """"didn't like spit all that much"""".[10] He switched his focus to business after three years,[11] and received an MBA in accounting and information systems in 1971. After graduating, he took a job with an accounting firm but quit to join the Chicago Police Department as an internal affairs investigator, specializing in forensic accounting. Hanssen left the department after two years, joining the FBI in January 1976.[7]

Hanssen met Bernadette """"Bonnie"""" Wauck while he was attending dental school in Chicago. Bonnie was one of eight children from a staunchly Roman Catholic family. The couple married in 1968. After Hanssen married, he converted from Lutheranism to his wife's Catholicism, becoming a fervent believer and being extensively involved in Opus Dei.
[edit] Early FBI career and first espionage activities (1979–1981)

Hanssen joined the FBI as a special agent on 12 January 1976 and was transferred to the field office in Gary, Indiana. In 1978, Hanssen and his growing family (of three children and eventually six) moved to New York when the FBI transferred him to its field office there.[12] The next year, Hanssen was moved into counter-intelligence and given the task of compiling a database of Soviet intelligence for the Bureau. It was then, in 1979, only three years after joining the FBI, that Hanssen began his career as a Soviet, and later a Russian, spy.

That year, Hanssen approached the GRU (the Soviet military intelligence agency) and offered his services. Hanssen never indicated any political or ideological motive for his activities, telling the FBI after he was caught that his only motivation was the money.[13] During his first espionage cycle, Hanssen told the GRU a significant amount, including information on FBI bugging activities and Bureau lists of suspected Soviet intelligence agents. His most important leak of information was the betrayal of Dmitri Polyakov, code named TOPHAT. Polyakov was a CIA informant for more than twenty years before his retirement in 1980, and passed enormous amounts of information to American intelligence while he rose to the rank of General in the Soviet Army. For unknown reasons, the Soviets did not act on their intelligence about Polyakov until he was betrayed a second time by CIA mole Aldrich Ames in 1985. Polyakov was arrested in 1986 and executed in 1988. Ames was officially blamed for giving Polyakov's name to the Soviets, but Hanssen's role remained unknown until after his arrest in 2001.[14]

Hanssen was nearly exposed in 1981, when Bonnie Hanssen caught her husband in their basement writing a letter to the Soviets. Hanssen admitted to her that he'd been giving information to the Soviets (motivated purely by his """"need"""" for money) and that he had received US$30,000 as payment, but he lied and said that he was only passing along false intelligence. Knowing this, Bonnie insisted that her husband go to confession, as is required in the Roman Catholic faith for those who have committed serious sins. The Opus Dei priest who allegedly heard Robert's confession is said to have told him to give the money to charity as an act of penance. This remains unconfirmed as under the Seal of Confession, “it is absolutely forbidden for a confessor to betray in any way a penitent in words or in any manner for any reason"""" (Canon 983.1) under penalty of """"latae sententiae excommunication” (Canon 1388.1). Hanssen told his wife that he gave the money to Mother Teresa, but it is unknown if he actually did so.[15] Hanssen then stopped spying for the Soviet Union until 1985.

Yes it was sourced to a blog, but I think it was reliable.  It has been published on the blog for a year and it is sourced to a court transcript. The pro se litigant was a Yale grad. The blog owner is a 3rd year law student and I don't think he would misquote a federal judge.  Isn't there a way to use that source, with whatever notations?

My statements of views are merely responding to yours.  You write """"I did write that the CA rule creates a double standard, because it does. It says one set of rules governs how the court must act when all parties are represented by counsel, and another set applies to pro se litigants."""".  I don't think that is true. What rule are your referring to?  To the best of my knowledge all the written rules are exactly the same in all courts for both pro ses and attorney except for 1.) ECF, which pro ses are frequently not allowed to use, 2.) pro se forms, which  pro ses aren't required to use.  An attorney could probably use the pro se forms if they wanted. 3.) appellate appendixes  in pro se cases the entire case file is sent over and there is no provision for joint appendixes, a disadvantage for pro ses.  There are also other procedures for pro ses, which are not in the rulessee the appellate procedures which I quoted from the case manuals. As I read the California manual, it seemed merely to instruct the judges to provide more explanation.  I don't remember reading anything that seemed to indicate that a pro se paper would be processed but the same paper from an attorney would be dismissed.

Criminal legislation is supposed to be clear.  A crime is supposed to be a crime no matter who does it unless they are mentally ill or a child.

If someone is jailed for disrupting a court, the Federal Rules require that the court say what the disruption consists of, so there should not be a question of what it was.

Please give me an example of a court order that you think a person can be jailed for not obeying, other than not paying alimony or child support, or not testifying when subpoened about a crime or not responding to a subpoena by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 You are now a Reviewer 

Hello. Your account has been granted the """"reviewer"""" userright, allowing you to review other users' edits on certain flagged pages. Pending changes, also known as flagged protection, is currently undergoing a two-month trial scheduled to end 15 August 2010.

Reviewers can review edits made by users who are not autoconfirmed to articles placed under pending changes. Pending changes is applied to only a small number of articles, similarly to how semi-protection is applied but in a more controlled way for the trial. The list of articles with pending changes awaiting review is located at Special:OldReviewedPages.

When reviewing, edits should be accepted if they are not obvious vandalism or BLP violations, and not clearly problematic in light of the reason given for protection (see Wikipedia:Reviewing process). More detailed documentation and guidelines can be found here.

If you do not want this userright, you may ask any administrator to remove it for you at any time.  —  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

f264dee8a1ba5672,"Regnerus Study: Criticism 

Previous versions of this article unnecessarily multiplied references to criticism of the New Family Structures Study. 

First of all, this article is ostensibly about the Witherspoon Institute, not the New Family Structures Study, and it does not make sense to devote so much space to one study in what is otherwise a small article about an organization that has done many other things, as mentioned in the earlier paragraphs. 

Further, there is already a reference to the fact that the Study received criticism, down toward the end of the article. That same sentence also refers to the fact that many scholars also voiced praise for the Study, and thereby gives much more balance than the earlier discussion of criticism.

The fact remains that the Study was published by a peer-reviewed journal and was conducted at a major research university that has not condemned it. Some people voiced concerns to the same university that the study had not been conducted properly and the university found that the concerns did not merit further scrutiny. This Study has received the same vetting that countless other academic studies have received, including ones that came to very different conclusions.

In short, previous representations of criticism in this article about this Study were unnecessarily long, presented the Study in a very biased light, and made this article into a forum for voicing opinions that is properly handled in the academy through the methods of peer review and institutional review that the Study already passed. By ignoring those very processes of review such discussion does a disservice to Wikipedia's readers and suggests that the critics have a problem with the academic review processes as such, not the New Family Structures Study itself.",0,0,0,0,0,0

You may have not realised that the items on your userpage release personal information about yourself (real name or age etc), which could be used against you in the future. While 99% of all the editors on Wikipedia are friendly, welcoming and harmless, there is a chance your personal information could be misused by editors not so 'high-minded'. A handful of editors have even felt real-world implications due to their Wikipedia edits and release of personal information. 

I have deleted some revisions of your userpage in respect to your privacy for the time being, just in case you wish to reverse on your decision to have such content on public display. As a result, the information is only available to administrators. You are, of course, welcome to ask myself or another administrator to restore them, but I just wanted to make you aware of the risks involved with releasing personal information on such a public forum. If you wish to to have the personal information removed so that even administrators cannot view it, I can request oversight on your behalf.

This has been done because the article appears to be about a real person, organization (band, club, company, etc.), or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article.

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

I really don't know who on the Stayfree page in the wiki , the wiki user is promotion. We can send you the content for the approval . It is genuine and original content for the periods , how to cure on those days . We would like to make awareness to women to use sanitary pads because it is very safe for the health.

Clearly you are acting in good faith, attempting to serve a useful purpose in informing people of information that stands to benefit their health. Unfortunately, however, this is an example of exactly the kind of thing which Wikipedia does not do, and it conflicts with several of Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. You are clearly intending to use Wikipedia to host a page about a product to publicise it. Whether the motivation behind doing this is to increase profits of the company making that product or """"for the good cause of the women in India"""" is irrelevant: Wikipedia is not for use to promote anything for any purpose. To put the same thing another way, the policy that Wikipedia is not for promotion applies just as much to promotion of good causes as it does to promotion of business interests. Trying to increase awareness of health issues in a population where there is widespread ignorance of those issues is no doubt a worthwhile thing to do, but it is not one of the things that Wikipedia does.

You should also be aware that editing on behalf of a business or organisation to write about a subject in which that business or organisation has a direct interest is brings you into conflict with Wikipedia's conflict of interest guidelines. A Wikipedia article needs to be written from a neutral point of view, and if you are writing on behalf of someone else in order to publicise a subject they are involved with, it is likely that you will find it difficult or impossible to write from such a neutral point of view. (In fact, in this case it is clear that you do not even wish to write from a neutral point of view, since your declared aim is to portray the campaign as a good thing.)

""""Stayfree India"""" has used several Wikipedia accounts, which have been blocked from editing, because their only purpose was using Wikipedia to promote their cause. They have evidently approached you to edit on their behalf, to continue the attempt to promote their cause. Under Wikipedia's policy on  abuse of multiple accounts, if any account is used to make edits on behalf of a blocked editor, thereby helping the blocked editor to evade the block, the account used for such purposes can be blocked too, as it is being used to circumvent Wikipedia's policies. As I said at the beginning of this message, I have no doubt that you are acting in good faith, and that is why I have taken the time and trouble to explain to you what the issues are, rather than simply blocking your account. You are welcome to contribute to Wikipedia on other topics, where you do not have a conflict of interest, would not be helping to evade blocks on other accounts, and would not be promoting a cause. However, continuing to edit in ways which conflicts with Wikipedia's policies in those respects will not be acceptable.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

What is your opinion on this, it's a phenomenon ripping Wikipedia apart from the seams, with fanatical supporters of Swami Vivekananda and his RSS revising history  to make people believe lies.

People who are relatively unknown (Non public figure = NPF)
Policy shortcut:
WP:NPF 
Wikipedia also contains biographies of people who, while notable enough for an entry, are not generally well known. In such cases, exercise restraint and include only material relevant to their notability, while omitting information that is irrelevant to the subject's notability. Material from third-party primary sources should not be used unless it has first been published by a reliable secondary source. Material published by the subject must be used with caution. (See Using the subject as a source.)

Material that may adversely affect a person's reputation should be treated with special care. In the laws of many countries, simply repeating the defamatory claims of another is illegal, and there are special protections for people who are not public figures. Any such potentially damaging information about a private person, if corroborated by multiple, highly reliable sources, may be cited if the Wikipedia article states that the sources make certain """"allegations"""", without the Wikipedia article taking a position on their truth.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Tim Vickers just erased my comments on his discussion page concerning Doug youvan, NukeH, MsTopeka, Hrafn, etc. Hrafn now claims to be retired. Hrafn has a Richard Dawkins' anti-Christian POV filling many articles with secular fascism similar to 1935 Germany. This time it is against Christians. Godwin has his law, saying that such a comment creates a losing argument. Again, the connection (funding) from Homeland Security / Defense to WP /GOOGle, using US Treasury money to ban free speech on WP is Sedition of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. That is a high crime; you are playing with fire; there will be Hell to pay for this in front of a future Congressional committee.""""

Yes, exactly. The material in the lead just summarizes, in one brief sentence, the later paragraph on Boswell's material. That is what the lead is supposed to do.
On the blog, first, it does not mention Sergius and Bacchus, the subject of this article. It's just a general criticism of Boswell's ideas; the mere fact that an image of the saints appear on the cover of his book is immaterial. Moreover, it's a self-published blog and not acceptable as a source here. Time to move on.

 Why LaVey anyway???? 

Well, so far, Reason Rules. The Neutrality sticker is still up, though LGagnon threatened, I believe, that it would only be temporary. Intellectually, I am actually rather satisfied to leave it at that.

But - Not!!!!!!!!! For one thing, I enjoy intellectual duelling much too much. All Hail Wikipedia! Ah, for the days of learning for the sake of learning!

I raised the question as part of my pursuit here: why LaVey? Why not Timothy McVeigh? Again, there's not enough room for everyone, so how were the selected selected? We know who is included. Who was excluded, or perhaps simply """"non-included,"""" i.e; unintentionally, in contradistinction to intentional exclusion?????!!

What is more, in view of the evolution of terrorism – to all intents and purposes –  virtually morphing  into a veritable weltanschauung, Timothy McVeigh takes on a new urgency, relevance and intellectual/philosophical challenge.

My fear is that the whole effort is loaded, biased, in violation of Wikipedia rules. The whole thing seems to be a charade to ride satanism in on the ratiocinative coattails of Objectivist Ayn Rand. Otherwise, again, why not Timothy McVeigh? Again, he explicitly mentioned, and is often discussed in terms of Randian libertarianism. She would disown him like a Bolshevik, of course, but then she would disown LaVey in utter disgust!!!! So, if there's room only for one of the two, why LaVey?

If I don't receive reasoned responses, I will edit LaVey out again. Again, boys and girls, my emphasis is on a truly Wikipedian neutral POV. AOluwatoyin

Russell was active in the Fabian socialist movement.  His political thought was certainly very sympathetic to many technocratic ideas, but was generally more abstract than any ideology.  Roads to Freedom makes patent his political promiscuity: Russell was willing to support any movement that would tend to push history towards human freedom, humane social relations, and the rational satisfaction of human needs.  (Although when nuclear war was concerned, he seemed to prefer social injustice to complete ruin).  On the other hand, Russell was deeply skeptical of technology and science in its influence on human society and culture.  The Scientific Outlook was his vision of a scientific dystopia—one which incorporates much of technocracy.  (For the uninitiated: it is somewhat similar to Brave New World).  Although the technocratic elements are not necessarily portrayed in a negative light, they are not left blameless for the resulting society.  All in all, it seems hard to imagine that book could be the work of an enthusiastic technocrat. — 06:39, 27 January 2007",0,0,0,0,0,0

Just look at the reference for the statement that you put into the article for the cite that you put in;  the cited reliable source reference doesn't say """"population density"""" is the issue, but, rather, that """"gang violence"""" is the issue.  If you want to add other sources for population density, too, that would be fine.  But, don't claim a cite says something it does not.  You have been repeatedly warned about sticking to the sources.  This is but another example of you failing to stick to the sources.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 The main things I disagree about the Haunted Castle post... 

""""No one realized that lives had been lost until later that night, when firefighters searching one of the burnt-out trailers discovered the bodies, thought at first to be mannequins.""""

This is not true. This was reported in our local papers as well. The night of the fire, the media were told almost nothing, and had to go by rumor. I spoke to the fire chief, as well as numerous others on the scene that night. You see, except for the extreme rear portions of the back of the trailers, where the walls were not made of plywood, everything except metal had been disintegrated to ash. The bodies were discovered before dark, as soon as the fire was extinguished, not much later in the night.
The firefighters knew that what they were dealing with were human remains: bones, blood, jewelry and even unburned clothes and wallets inside pockets on those insulated on the bottom of the pile. (I've seen the photos) Additionally, the stench of burned flesh was overpowering, being noticed by patrons exiting the park from the main exit, separated only by a chain link fence from the Haunted Castle trailers. Wax mannequins would have been long-since melted. 
The truth is that the management at first claimed (and might have believed) to firefighters that they had evacuated all patrons from the HC, and there was no reason to close the park. The  castle was isolated, so the fire couldn't spread to other buildings. The fire was out by 7:45, and the park closed at 8:00 p.m. I've never heard of SFGA kicking everybody of the park during an otherwise fairly busy night, with fair weather with a free return pass. An unprecedented decision was made and implemented in 15 minutes. Given this time frame, they clearly found the bodies instantly, and there wasn't time to think that they were """"mannequins"""".    

""""Eight days after the fire, a statement by the Ocean County Prosecutor's Office said a 13-year-old boy had called the police after hearing radio reports that investigators were looking for witnesses. The boy told the police that he had been befriended by a 14-year-old boy at the castle's entrance. He said the older youth, who appeared to be familiar with the castle, offered to guide him through. He said the older youth used a cigarette lighter to find his way down a long corridor that was dark because of a malfunctioning strobe light, and eventually bumped into and ignited a foam-rubber wall pad. The prosecutor exonerated the older youth, who has never been identified, of any criminal wrongdoing.""""
Police knew the identities of both boys by very early the next morning, and interviewed both Saturday May 12th.  The younger boy's parents had called authorities without being prompted by any radio broadcast. The older boy was turned in by his teacher, who had seen him unattended, exit a burning Haunted Castle, and alerted police as soon as he could. This boy set numerous fires. Bumping up against the strobe pad could not have accidentally ignited it. Try to reproduce such a thing. It takes about 30 seconds to set fire to polyurethane foam. It is unclear why the prosecutor didn't go after him.

""""According to news reports of the trial, no such boy was ever found, and no other witness testified to seeing such a boy. Under cross-examination by the defense, the witness denied starting the fire himself.""""

Although its true as it is quote from the article, the identity of the boy was well known to investigators.

I think there should be added also be added mention of the name of the ninth person who lived from the ill-fated group, the legacy of exploitation and disrespect that has been associated with the property, as well as numerous other facts.

Thanks!

0b2a553f4d6660ed,"Yes, I am saying that 9.000... > 9. This follows from the previous steps in complete agreement with previous assumptions. I will not discuss the  infinitesimal because it is nonsense. There are no infinitesimals in the real numbers or any other numbers. Non-standard numbers are also nonsense. I have illustrated clearly what happens when you treat a 'false' assumption as true, you end up with a contradiction. The false assumption here is that 0.999...=1.
It is not possible to find an epsilon = 1-0.999... just as it is impossible for you to completely represent an irrational number. You don't seem to have a problem with using pi or other irrational numbers as approximations but you have the audacity (or rather foolishness) to make wild claims like the ones in your main article. By definition, 1 > 0.999... There is no duplicate representation. It is your attempt to have this equality that gives rise to duplicate representation. Quite frankly it does not matter that we can't find an epsilon = 1 - 0.999... because our arithemetic deals only with *finitely represented* quantities or approximations in all other calculations where we cannot completely represent given numbers.

Sorry, my bad. In response to the query you left on my talk page, some specific (but by no means the only) examples which I found problematic are:
""""However, a significantly smaller group of people know the name and person behind the images. The fame and fortune of artists are notoriously mercurial; Grossman's personal profile is demonstrably due a raise.""""
""""Ceaselessly toiling in the field of illustration since the 1960s, Grossman has amassed an impressive, enormous body of work...""""
""""At a separate website, which may be accessed through his main site, T-shirts bearing Grossman's designs are available.""""
The first and third of those should probably be removed altogether - it isn't the purpose of Wikipedia to raise Grossman's profile, nor to sell his t-shirts. The second could be made more neutral by changing it to:
""""Having worked in the field of illustration since the 1960s, Grossman has amassed an sizeable body of work...""""
Also, several sections of the article (""""Painter"""", """"Sculptor"""", """"These days"""") don't cite any sources, so things like:
""""surveying four decades of Grossman creations, one finds that """"the awkward, early work"""" and the """"tired, later work"""" simply don't exist.""""
have a tendancy to read like your own personal opinions. The article as a whole seems to paint a rosy picture of Grossman, but I don't see much in the way of critical assessment of his work. I would say in general that you need to be wary of WP:NPOV, WP:NOR and WP:V. Personally, I always find it useful to look at several featured articles to get an idea of the kind of standards I should be aiming for.

That's just my opinion, of course. ) It might be an idea for you to list the article at Wikipedia:Requests for feedback to get a few comments from other users.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0
