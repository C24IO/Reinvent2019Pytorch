 == Resolution 687 == 
 Silverback, you removed 
 :""""in violation of UN Security Council Resolution 687(notably point 22);"""" 
 with the comment 
 :""""rv, this text does not make the case claimed for it, obviously congress was judging Saddam's behavior, if he complied with the UN that in itself would be regime change, the lack of a treaty is decisiv"""" 
 Would you mind extrapolate a little bit, I am not quite sure that I follow you... Sorry if I am slow to grasp the meaning p   

 The continual charge that the Iraq Liberation act is either a violation of 687 or in international law in general is open to wide speculation. Christian lost this fight over in the Iraq Liberation act article and now wants to try it again here. Furthermore, I cannot find a credible source that states that the ILA is a violation of 686 or international law. Law, and UN resolutions in general are subject to a wide variation of interpretation, that’s why we have lawyers and judges and juries. If a source can be found then perhaps the reverted material can be added to the article, otherwise it be gone and it stay gone.   

 : Thank you for yout input. The argument here, as I understand it, is that the statement by the USA that only the removal of Saddam Hussein will permit the lifting of the sanctions does not match the UN resolution 687; indeed, in the resolution, a set of conditions is defined for the lifting of the sanctions, which nowhere demands a change of government. I suppose that the argument developed here means that no other resolution of the UN demanded the departure of Saddam Hussein, and that as such, the ultimatum made by the USA was not in a continuation of the UN process. On this particular point, the UN resolution leave very little room for interpretation, it does not make mention of a change of power.   

 Excuse me all, but could we please discuss the reasons which led Silverback to remove the piece in the the first place, as well as the oportunity of putting the piece here, rather than keeping reverting back and fro without any proper reason ? I say this in the interest of the nerves of all the parties, as well as for the poor server which is striving to catch on...   

 ::The references did not seem logically connected to any argument that this law violated international law. The provisions cited relied upon the security council to lift sanctions.  Since the US has a veto on the council, if the US says the sanctions will only be lifted under certain conditions such as regime change, it obviously has the means within the article you cite to make sure those conditions are met, or at least the sanctions stay on the books. The US has a veto on the findings of fact. The behavior of other members on the security council demonstrate they feel no obligation to be intellectually honest in the evaluation of the facts. The US of course would have had to have done much more to prevent the cheating on the sanctions by several of the parties that voted for them.  How could the law passed by congress, be in anyway a violation of those provisions of the sanctions, it seems quite within them.  Now if the law unilaterally lifted the sanctions, or authorized the US government to cheat on them, then it would be a violation under those provisions, just as the cheating by other security council members was.  

 : Seems like an arguable interpretation.  I'm not comfortable with the statement as a fact that the Act was in violation of of Resolution 687, and I'd like to see some reasonable reference to a legal argument being made for this if I'd even want it included as a notable opinion. It looks to me like it's probably a bit of original research as suggested. |

 == Merger proposal == 
 This is the same distribution as Generalized normal distribution. While it shouldn't be too hard to merge the two, the main question is which name to use? Any comments? -   
 :One thing that needs thinking about is how to handle other distributions which are also called """"generalised normal"""". For example, documentaion for R includes a generalised normal distribution which is not the one referred to here (see eg.  ). Nether of these distributions is what is called either the skew-generalised normal or skew-normal distribution. Also I note that the ISI glossary has """"Kapteyn's univariate distribution"""" as an alternative name for a generalised normal (not clear which) , but I guess this name should be avoided.    

 I agree. I added this page recently because I didn't find this distribution (under either name) on the List of probability distributions page.  Since """"Gaussian distribution"""" redirects to """"Normal distribution"""", I propose that we merge these two pages under """"generalized normal distribution"""" with a redirect from """"generalized Gaussian distribution.""""  Then we can add a comment in the text about the """"Kapteyn"""" name.  I don't know what to do about the other generalized normal distribution.  Maybe we could have them on the same page with two copies of the probability distribution template.    

 On further investigation, the generalized normal distribution referred to in the R documentation cited above () does not appear to include the normal distribution as a special case (also, the literature reference in the R code is to a 1990 paper of Hosking's, but this paper does not discuss anything like the distribution in the R code, and I didn't find any use of the term """"generalized normal"""" in Hosking's other papers on JSTOR).  In that sense, it is """"generalized"""" in the same way that the lognormal, inverse normal, and half-normal distributions are (i.e. derived from the normal via a transformation).  I think we can clarify that """"generalized here"""" means a parameteric family that includes the normal distribution as a special case.  This includes skew-normal, which already has a page that we can link to.

 To reply on what Frank Close actually says: 

 ;Extracts from Chapter 9, The Infinity Puzzle, 2013. Relevant snips underlined, rest is to add context 
 * Although several people discovered the mechanism whereby vector gauge bosons can acquire mass, Brout and Englert being the first to publish a relativistic demonstration, only Higgs drew attention to the consequential existence of a massive scalar particle, which now bears his name. 

 * By the late summer of 1964 they [Guralnik and Hagen] had """"pretty much everything but still had concerns over some fine details."""" His former mentor Walter Gilbert was lecturing at a summer school at Lake Como, so Guralnik made a special trip to tell him what they had achieved.... At the very time when Guralnik was talking with Gilbert, Higgs’s paper was already in production. This would become apparent only later... 

 * Unaware of this even more precious jewel that lay just out of their reach, Guralnik and Hagen drafted a manuscript, and showed it to Kibble, asking for any additional input. Fate was about to deal them a cruel blow. During 1964 Britain had had a series of postal strikes, which had delayed the mail. Their memory of events, as described in several accounts,[29] is that as they were about to send the final version of their manuscript to PRL, Kibble came in and announced that in the backlog of mail were """"three papers, one by Robert Brout and François Englert... and two by Peter Higgs."""" All three also seemed to have discovered how a gauge boson could become massive.  

 * Guralnik, Hagen, and Kibble’s work was tightly argued and contained unique insights toward understanding the depth of these new ideas. However, the sad fact was that they had been scooped. They added references to those papers into the text but changed nothing, nor did they add anything as a result of what had happened. They sent the manuscript to Physical Review Letters, where it was received on October 12, 1964.... By that oversight, they had implicitly placed themselves as runners-up... 

 * Gerald Guralnik was one of those who approached the finishing line early but failed to publish fast enough. 

 * In another of the coincidences in this tale, the editor of PRL received Higgs’s manuscript on the very same day that Brout and Englert’s paper was published. When Higgs’s paper finally appeared in print, on October 19, Brout and Englert were surprised to see that it included a reference to their own: """"He couldn’t have seen our paper, so how did he know of it?"""" Higgs explained: Nambu had been the referee of both papers and """"had drawn attention to the work of Brout and Englert. I added a remark about their work."""" Their researches were truly independent; in 1964 manuscripts were typed and then submitted by the regular mail. [...] There is no dispute that Brout and Englert were first to complete and first to publish. So why is it that Higgs’s name is associated with the massive boson and not those of Englert or Brout? The answer is that so far everyone has been addressing what happened to Goldstone’s massless boson. However, there remains the issue of Goldstone’s other boson—the massive one. This is what Higgs had uniquely included in his revised paper, the one that appeared in PRL. Two years later, he developed the ideas in a longer paper, setting in motion the events that would make his name. 

 * So it was that Brout, Englert, and Higgs had all published papers, while GHK were writing their own paper, ignorant of developments due to the British postal strike until the fateful moment when Kibble announced the news. 

 * Tom Kibble recalled: """"As a matter of fact [in 1964] the Higgs Boson was not seen by anyone as a particularly important feature. The interest [then] was in the way the gauge vector bosons acquired a mass, eating up the Goldstone [massless] Boson on the way. Now of course it’s important because... its observation would confirm the validity of the theory."""" ... Kibble’s perception of the perceived unimportance historically is in accord with the memories of others, which were aired when the six shared the Sakurai Prize in 2010. For Englert and Brout, """"This was our first paper in field theory and we were somewhat isolated. We didn’t know about Glashow’s work [on the SU2 × U1 model of the weak and electromagnetic forces] at all."""" 

 * During the International Conference on High Energy Physics at Berkeley in 1966, Ben Lee prominently referred to the “Higgs Boson” and the “Higgs Mechanism.” ... As the GHK team, including Hagen, had not completed their paper until after the appearance of Higgs’s original papers, and as Higgs had built on this further during 1966, with a study of how"

What I am saying, however, is that something as simple as infobox inclusions should be consensual and fair. That appears to be what everyone is not in consensus with. I don't see why we're confusing readers by making it seem as though the election is currently between four parties. Technically, it's between many parties. Four (or really, five) have the gained the ability to be on ballots that would accumulate 270 electoral votes. Two dominate the race. If and when the latter changes (which would be caused by media coverage, by the way, as very real as ballot access) we should reflect that. Currently, we're fooling people due to bureaucracy (at a superficial level, at least). My comments about the 2000 election were an example of possible overcoverage. Had that been on ongoing eletion, like this one, you would likely be supporting their negligable entries in the infobox.

 I focused specifically on the Behavior section of this article.  
 Hyperlinks I added: Shoaling, olfactory, altruistic, alertness, northern pike 

 From the section “Alarm substance”: 
 “The production and release of this alarm substance are altruistic because the sender of the signal, who does not directly benefit from the signal released upon its injury has to pay the cost for the production and release of the chemical”  
 I found this sentence to be extremely confusing so I tried to fix it up. The author should go back and try to further clarify it, though. I also made quite a few wording edits to this section.  

 I added in spaces between the paragraphs, which were absent before. This should make everything in the article look a little cleaner.  
 The section on Predator inspection was very good and thorough. I just made some sentence structure and wording changes. The author may want to consider clearing up the second paragraph about the minnows’ interactions with the Northern Pike.  

 Overall, this was very well written and pretty thorough. I made minor wording changes but did not do anything major. My suggestions for the author are below. 

 Suggestions for the author: 
 • 	 In the Shoaling section, clarify what you mean by “increased risk of infection.” Are there specific diseases or parasites that affect this minnow? 
 • 	 Clarify where you talk about how “naïve common minnows”  
 • 	 The shoaling section was very broad and could probably be expanded upon to be more specific to minnows. Right now, it seems like it is just talking about fish in general. 
 • 	 In the section, “Shoaling adjustment in response to predation risk”, talk about why those individuals in the central group are in the best position.  
 • 	 Expand on the Foraging section, perhaps talk about their diet and how that relates to shoaling behavior being beneficial."

 The National Resources Stewardship Program writes, Four hundred and forty million years ago, when CO2 levels are estimated to have been more than 10 times today's, our planet was in the depths of the coldest period in the last half billion years. At other times, high CO2 levels coincided with warm periods. There is no meaningful correlation with temperature in the geological record. 

 Over the past half million years, the Antarctic ice core records show a remarkable link between temperature and CO2 . Yet, these records consistently show that temperature rises some 800 years before CO2 rises, not after it. 

 Even over the past century the CO2/warming correlation is poor, with significant cooling taking place between 1940 and 1980 while human-produced CO2 emissions were increasing rapidly. In all these records there is no evidence to show that CO2 has ever acted as a climate driver or even as a significant secondary effect to accelerate climate warming.

Next time it was removed by giving more acceptable reasoning. Now I am back to researching. It is indeed a very good thing that statements are vigorously checked before allowed into the encyclopedia. I wrote my statement assuming the earlier slack standard.  

 I came here only to check the melting point of coconut oil because the second jar I bought of the same brand name did not solidify as the first one did. Now I know that the second jar is not truly pure coconut oil as claimed. I was born in Sri Lanka and lived there during the time coconut milk was the base of every dish. There was only one cooking oil, coconut oil. Then in 1970s there was a campaign warning against use of coconut oil in favor of imported vegetable oil (and also margarine over butter). In those days, heart disease and diabetes were called """"rich people's diseases"""". In my second half of life in America, we did not use coconut oil. Then when my memory started to fail, the doctor prescribed Donepezil HCl tablets after seeing steady decline in two visits. That caused waking time and dreams to fuse in me. He then asked me to read on coconut oil  not a prescription. My med student daughter watched on with no comment. I found and read Dr. Bruce Fife's book on Alzheimer's. I took 3 teaspoons of it daily for about a month with remarkable results. Two of my friends older than me started to do the same saying it is better to die with dignity than to become walking trees.  

 I told this story to illustrate that science authorities may not be the best and only source of useful knowledge, and that knowledge has wider utility. Social control is not the purpose of an encyclopedia. (What are we saying in the 'god' page?) May be top of each page can give links to scientific authorities to tell people that if they are looking for advice, those are the places they ought to go to. I would prefer the encyclopedia to be more open about showing available knowledge with ample hints that some are not scientifically affirmed.

 Hi, I've been working on an article on Joshua Dratel and had gotten it to be a decent little stub. But then when I went to create it I discovered that it had been previously AFD'd and deleted from both versions of his name. Once I saw that I decided my stub needed to be a little better than decent so I've been working on it. Somebody just pointed out to me that you're working on an article on Joshua Dratel also, so I figured I should contact you. 

 Obviously I think the guy is notable and don't agree with the Delete arguments set out at the AFD. Still, I'm going to take those arguments seriously, so I want any new Joshua Dratel article to refute those arguments beyond a shadow of a doubt. I don't think the draft you've written quite does that as clearly as I like. (I'm not saying you haven't put a ton of work into it, you clearly have.) It's just that the flavor of the AFD made me expect any new article to encounter some good faith but strongly felt opposition. 

 Could you please hold off just a little bit on putting it in article main space to give me alittle more time to follow some leads? Right now I'm following up on some research ideas. Or at least let me know when it goes live so I'm ready to help out.

 ::: I appreciate your candor,  and  and also value your experience. Although I created my original account in 2007, I've only been active in a regular fashion here since July 2013. I've read over some of Kudpung's work analyzing the RfA process, the pages of conversation on reform which seem to occur annually until 2013. I'm sure if I read over some of the proposals that were posted at the Village Pump and died a quiet death, I'd be even more depressed!  
 ::: Change takes a lot of effort and coordinated (or semi-coordinated) action by a group of respected editors and admins. It also seems like there were years (2006-2008) when a lot of change happened and policies created so it could be that, after 13 years, Wikipedia has become somewhat ossified and less flexible to the introduction of new ideas. I also know that there are fewer editors and they are spread thinly throughout the project. Just in the year I've been active, I see less participation at WP:AN/I than there was 6 months ago (which could be a bad or good thing!). With so much effort by admins and editors just to keep up with the backlog, it leaves less time and fewer people to discuss policy proposals (at least, until a crisis occurs). Good policy is not made by reacting to crises but sometimes it is the only way change happens.    """

 ==The Tea Leaf - Issue Two== 
 Hi! Welcome to the second edition of The Tea Leaf, the official newsletter of the Teahouse!  
 *Teahouse celebrates one month of being open! This first month has drawn a lot of community interest to the Teahouse. Hosts & community members have been working with the project team to improve the project in many ways including creating scripts to make inviting easier, exploring mediation processes for troubling guests, and best practices regarding mentoring for new editors who visit the Teahouse.  

 *First month metrics report an average of 30 new editors visiting the Teahouse each week. Approximately 30 new editors participate in the Teahouse each week, by way of asking questions and making guest profiles. An average of six new questions and four new profiles are made each day. We'd love tohear your ideas about how we can spread the word about the Teahouse to more new editors. 
 *Teahouse has many regulars. Like any great teahouse, our Teahouse has a 61% return rate of guests, who come back to ask additional questions and to also help answer others' questions. Return guests cite the speedy response rate of hosts and the friendly, easy to understand responses by the hosts and other participants as the main reasons for coming back for another cup o' tea! 
 *Early metrics on retention. It's still too early to draw conclusions about the Teahouse's impact on new editor retention, but, early data shows that 38% of new editors who participate at the Teahouse are still actively editing Wikipedia 2-4 weeks later, this is compared with 7% from a control group of uninvited new editors who showed similar first day editing activity. Additional metrics can be found on the Teahouse metrics page. 
 *Nine new hosts welcomed to the Teahouse. Nine new hosts have been welcomed to the Teahouse during month one: ,, ,, , ,, , and. Welcome to the Teahouse gang, folks!  
 *Say hello to the new guests at the Teahouse. Take the time to welcome and get to know the latest guests at the Teahouse. Drop off some wikilove to these editors today, as being welcomed by experienced editors is a really nice way to make new editors feel welcome.

 ::Verifiability is a necessary but not sufficient criteria for inclusion.  And since reliable sources can sometimes conflict with one another, sources must be weighed in context.  In short, just because you can find a cite for something, doesn't mean it automatically merits inclusion in wikipedia.  """"Pasta is made out of wheat"""" is a true verifiable statement, but it doesn't belong in this article.  """"There's a sea monster in Loch Ness"""" can be easily sourced, but that doesn't mean we should uncritically re-state it, even though many sources say this.  In other words, it may not be our job to determine what's a misconception and what isn't, but it is our job to weigh reliable sources. 

  
 ::From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources: 
 :::The reliability of a source depends on context. Each source must be carefully weighed to judge whether it is reliable for the statement being made and is the best such source for that context. In general, the more people engaged in checking facts, analyzing legal issues, and scrutinizing the writing, the more reliable the publication. Sources should directly support the information as it is presented in an article, and should be appropriate to the claims made. If no reliable sources can be found on a topic, Wikipedia should not have an article on it...   
 :::Articles should be based on reliable, third-party, published sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy. This means that we only publish the opinions of reliable authors, and not the opinions of Wikipedians who have read and interpreted primary source material for themselves. 

 ::Here, we have two style-guides from minor universities making a claim.  Who actually wrote the articles?  Were they peer-reviewed, or otherwise edited?  Or were they just posted by a part time summer intern?  We have no way of knowing. Meanwhile, we can't turn up even a single source of someone actually making the claim """"hyhens and dashes are the same"""". Again, I ask the question: if this misconception is so common, why are there no examples of it? That's truly puzzling, don't you think?  The Loch Ness Monster analogy above is apt -  we have two sources saying that something exists, but nobody can come up with an example in the wild. 
 ::So, I question the reliability of the sources, but not strongly enough to remove the entry as unsourced.  

 ::To answer your questions: 1) Unlike the previous cites, the two new cites contain wording that is sufficient to base the article on.  I question whether these sources are sufficiently reliable.  3) I am not """"bent"""" on removing this section; before today I thought it was unsourced since it required interpretation to get from what was written in the source to what was in the article, now I think it is sourced but question how reliable those sources are. Aside from the verifiability issue, there's the editorial decision of whether the entry makes sense in the context of the rest of the article - my view as an editor is that it sticks out like a sore thumb as distinctly different than the other entries on the page.  An Rfc makes sense, since it doesn't appear the 3rd opinion got us very far.   """

 Offline Send Email  

 Morons have polluting the Wikipedia page, trying to link NLP to Dianetics and 
 Scientology, 
 because obviously enneagrams = engrams....(even though nobody in NLP uses the 
 term 
 engram, other than some fringe loser author who absolutely nobody references 
 except 
 for these cranks  who, it seems, have some financial and/or 
 professional-status 
 motivation to slander the NLP community.

 It's time to bring some people more knowledgeable than myself into this. 

 Plus, 10 people can pick apart the arguments of these cranks better than one. 

 Aaron 

  
 According to the NLP article history, Metta Bubble, DejaKitty, and Blauregen joined soon after the message was sent.  There were also some anonymous IPs that also joined in the fact deletions and advocacy thereof.  

 I'm sure Wikipedia has nothing against someone's belief in remote influence, Kahuna sect, or Ha Prayer Rituals, and of course it is a free world mostly and one should not be banned or persecuted for remote viewing, telepathic hypnosis, or pyramid energy development as they wish.  However, that background may cause a slight bias towards pseudoscientific thinking.   

 I will post the appropriate meatpuppet messages.

 Know about UIDAI Authority & its projects. 

 The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) (Hindi: भारतीय विशिष्ट पहचान प्राधिकरण), is an agency of the Government of India responsible for implementing the envisioned Multipurpose National Identity Card or Unique Identification card (UID Card) project in India. It was established in February 2009, and will own and operate the Unique Identification Number database. The authority will aim at providing a unique number to all Indians, but not smart cards. The authority would provide a database of residents containing very simple data in biometrics. 
 The agency is headed by a chairman, who holds a cabinet rank. The UIDAI is part of the Planning Commission of India. Mr. Nandan Nilekani, a former co-chairman of Infosys Technologies, was appointed as the first Chairman of the authority in June 2009.Mr. Ram Sewak Sharma, an IAS Officer of Jharkhand Government cadre has been appointed as the Director General and Mission Director of the Authority. He is known for his best effort in e-Governance project for Jharkhand State and working as an IT secretary he received a number of awards for best Information Technology Trends State in India. 

 Launch 

 UIDAI launched AADHAAR program in the tribal village, Tembhli, in Shahada, Nandurbar, Maharashtra on 29th September, 2010. The program was inaugurated by Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh along with UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi. The first resident to receive an AADHAAR was Rajana Sonawane of Tembhli village.

 Hi! Completely understand why you made your edit.

Charles Ardai's involvement is tougher to turn up a good link for (though he's talked about it himself in numerous interviews, on his Twitter page, and in e-mails to the Hard Case Crime mailing list).  I did find this, though: http://multipleverses.com/2010/06/29/syfys-haven-set-to-premiere-july-9-interview-with-cast-plus-promo-photos/.  It contains a transcript of a conference call held recently by the show's two creators and two main stars, in which the creators say this, """"Charles Cartwright...who is the publisher of THE COLORADO KID and pretty tight with Mr. King is actually writing at least one if not more of the episodes this season. He was the publisher of Hard Case Crime that THE COLORADO KID was published under and is an author in his own right.""""  (Obviously whoever transcribed the audio didn't understand the word """"Ardai"""" and transcribed it as """"Cartwright""""; Charles Ardai is clearly the person they're talking about, since he's the editor of Hard Case Crime and the publisher of THE COLORADO KID.) 

 But this will all be moot in, what, 10 days?  At that point anyone will be able to verify the information simply by watching the show and reading the credits on the screen."""

 WP:STUB defines a stub article as """"an article containing only a few sentences of text which is too short to provide encyclopedic coverage of a subject, but not so short as to provide no useful information"""". I cannot find anything in WP:STUB (or in WP:BIO or WP:NO 	 ILITY) which suggests that the presence of a stub tag makes a subject notable; it seems to me that a stub tag is neutral on the question of notability, and serves only to define the article as being """"too short to provide encyclopedic coverage"""". However, you appear to assume that the presence a stub tag is not just an assertion of notability, but proof of notability. Why?   •   

 :No. I don't believe I said that. If I did that is wrong. What I said was that where an article had been commenced (not necessarily by me) as a stub (with which WP is littered) and that the whole concept (as I understood it) of a stub was that the initial editor might not have had that much info to hand but felt the subject important enough for a small entry (most encyclopaedias have small, sometimes tiny entries), which could then be added to by others. I think you are referring to a baronet stub. Obviously we differ. In Britain a Baronet is a minor notable in his own right because he holds that title, either directly or hereditarily, from the monarch. I have known this sinc I was a child and I find it incredulous that a group or groups of people set themselves up as somehow above the monarch and decides that none of these people are notables. It is bizarre. That is not how society works and it should not be how WP works.   
 ::That is not what BHG said. What she asserts is that none of these people are automatically notable. And that each may be notable but each depends on its own facts. -   
 :::David, the point of a stub tag is to say """"this article is to short, and should be expanded if it is going to provide encyclopedic coverage"""". In any topic, it's still legitimate for an editor to ask whether that really is an article worth expanding. Plenty of stubs are deleted at AfD on a regular basis.   •

 ::You are correct, I think the United Nations is a ridiculous organization.  One of its primary reasons for creation was to make sure a Holocaust never happened again.  Just like your belief that sometimes murder is justified (for the record, not all killing is murder, but I won't use scare quotes around the word because I think that's childish in a debate with someone), I am an idealist about some things, and genocide is one.  That might be surprising considering my other statements, but systematic extermination does boil my blood.  My major problem with Clinton was his turning a blind eye to Rwanda, a case where I wouldn't have minded losing American lives to ensure the slaughter ended.  It's an issue almost totally ignored here in the States, and in relation to the United Nations. (It's also my main problem with Bush, his ignoring of the Sudan """"crisis"""" - I use scare quotes there, because it's obviously a genocide.)  It has to do with the motives behind the killing, I think, that makes me so angry/upset.  We killed far more Vietnamese with bombs than the soldiers did in My Lai, but My Lai is the one that pisses me off.  The Japanese killed 3000 Americans at Pearl Harbor, but the Rape of Nanking gets me more upset.  And don't get me started on the Holocaust, there's no words to describe my feelings for that crime.  I could probably find more instances where the deaths of non-Americans upset me more than Americans, but none pop immediately to mind.

 At the very least, please acknowledge that these are not definitions of class IIB. These are """"suggested phrases for writing a recommendation"""".

 == Back to the lead section == 

 We are now going to completely re-work the lead section. 

 The failed Feature Article attempt verifies that the lead section sucks.  What the lead section fails to do is identify the Importance of this dead female.  We fail to convey the the end of 2003 and March 2005 as big events.  Factions formed.  Money flowed.  Politics.  American Politics.  The lead section must give the broad scope and do so tersely.  Yes, there are subpages, but this the captone.  The executive plan. 

 Try this on for size: The court rulings were uniform: TS's parents (TSP) were wrong and Michael was right.   TS's parent's efforts merely delayed the inevitable.  Much like the South in the American Civil War, TS's parents merely fought a Lost Cause.  They simply spend a bunch of money, and had a lot of publicity that stretched out over seven years. 

 When you put it in perspective, it loses some glamour!  No pretty young face.  No propaganda.  All that stupid fighting within Wikipedia: you just forget about it. 

 I have presented my case that the pretty photo does NOT belong in the lead section. It goes to the """"early life"""" where it belongs.  She was NOT notable when she had that pretty face.  The pretty face is merely a lie proprigated the TSP.  That pretty woman was gone forever.  If we put any such photo into the lead section, it will be the REAL photo.  Brain-dead Terri in bed.  Drooling. Snot running out of nose.  Full bedpan.  THAT is what the judge had to make a deicision.  We need THAT view in order to understand what the judges faced.  Otherwise we are simply re-trying the case in the press!  That is not how it works. 

 If people have trouble seeing Terri's Soul in that drooling, shitting person, then that is their problem.  That is simply their inabiilty to face the reality of this woman. Some superficial you people may not like that.  Tough. 

 And the courts are just going to be the same old monotonous story: Delay by TSP via appeal and then loss incurred by TSP. 

 The Florida legislature and the U.S. Congress actions get mentions in the lead section.  THAT was why this story ever mattered at all. Whever this female was is just a pile of ashes now. TS WAS notable. 

 We need a quick statement about the left and right involved. There are a LOT more right-wingers, a lot more right-wing money and a lot more right-wing propaganda involved.  There was some leftist activities, but not nearly as much.  It is all that right-wing power and money that is going to emerge when Abortion comes around again as the other life/death issue. 

 We have tried several times to get feedback.  Negotiation.  Comprosmise.  This bullshit about maintaining the status quo on this crappy article with its crappy lead section is over.  It does not matter how intricate the footnotes are or how perfect the syntax is if the reader has to slog through it and get no help in recognizing the historical context. 

 The historical context is these right-wing events: 
 *Elizabeth Morgan 
 *Terri Shchiavo 
 *Abortion 
 If they win next, maybe on abortion, I can accept that.  If the right loses, I can accept that too, but I do not really care very much. 

 This bullshit about she-said-the-he-said-that blah blah is BULLSHIT!  The nurses affidavit barely merits a mention because the judge dismissed it, pratically out-of-hand. 

 This bullshit about Canadians and British pro-lifers coming and stroking the hysteria about this fairly-easy-to-write aritcle will END.

And I didn't just 'overturn' concensus, but I actually took into consideration the RSN about this which said that trees themselves are not reliable, but the primary documents themselves are useful. This should not be hard concept to grasp, but in the discussion was geared towards 'primary documents' being OK (as under RS and other primary document criteria) and the 'family trees' made by amateurs are not reliable. All of the 'External links' were just a 'family tree', of which did not even cover Richard Tylman himself, but the presumed son and grandson as well. Poetic does not even have assess to the sources that he added, so even if we were to go for the better PRIMARY documents, the problem is that there is clear errors in the forms used and the best one represents a single line entry in a log book, and nothing more. Even the best source we have makes no mention about Richard Tylman being the mayor, and much of the prose here is wrong in its assertions. I'm not 'edit warring' and I haven't gone and addressed the OTHER issues because I don't want to deal with this every day I'm on wiki. And there actually SEEMS to be concensus about the links themselves not being reliable, which logically defaults to not being valid sources. Clemrutter even acknowledges this point as above. One of the 'includes' was a Sockpuppet and is invalid, yet it had no arguement either. The other was on the 'let readers decide if it is authoritive'.  
 :: If you want a proper gauge of the discussion, see the RSN entry as I noted. Its more obvious and detailed. Also the only two people who really made arguments were TFD and Poetic, both were active on the RSN debate as well. The fact three individuals on this RFC (which took place at the same time as the RSN debate) also have expressed concerns about the validity of the sources really defaults to the 3 Removes and 1 Yes (Poetic). A close with no concensus still equals removal. Either way, it doesn't change the result and no one on ANI or in the side discusses has dealt with the issues themselves, instead of the action of the close. Those who have expressed concerns with the sources did so in policy and knew that there really was no way they would have remained valid. Its because they do not pass RS, V and ELNO, not because I'm being a jerk. I could have closed it as 'no concensus' and still removed the things as according to policy. Instead I gave a solid answer on why TFD's argument won out in light of policy. Either way, if I closed as 'no concensus, removing links per policy' the outcome would have been no different to worse. Ironic thing, I don't even know why the previous incarnation of the poet Richard Tylman was deleted. It seems stupid to me and I have half a mind to try and resurrect the page, but Poetic is absent for now and I won't risk further ire by doing so. I'm not a 'bad guy', and I'm really level headed.

 == Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Vianello == 

 Vianello, I am sorry to inform you that I have closed your RfA as unlikely to reach consensus: there was a 6:1 ratio against the request at the time of processing. However, don't be downhearted by this: I can assure you that your contributions are both highly welcome and valued—many editors have failed their first request for adminship, only to sail through later and become well-respected administrators. 

 You may wish to review the Guide to RfA before submitting future nominations, as well as well as here and here, both of which list the more highly-supported RfAs. Additionally, admin coaching is a useful aid for editors interested in becoming an administrator. If I can assist you at all, please do not hesitate to contact me. Kindest regards,   

 :I would like to say that your responses to the WP:SNOW closing of this RfA were a great example of why I believe you will make a fine admin sometime in the future. I don't do admin coaching, or mentoring, or any of that stuff (because I don't want to commit to something with consequences to other people if I develop some problem with it) but if there are any questions that occur to you on which you might wish to hear the opinion of one admin, then my  is at your disposal. In the meantime, go the places where admins go and work out why they do what they do, work in article space to get a feel for what the encyclopedia is really all about, visit the policy pages and see how they relate to what you are learning, and ask questions of anyone you think might be able to help you. Let me know when you think you might re-apply. Cheers.    

 == Clarification == 

 When I made mention of CSD in your RfA, I had noticed a few errors of requesting speedy. Too many incorrectly placed speedy tags can hurt a future RfA. My apologies for not expounding while it was open, as I was offline. The other admin related areas most people look for is contributing to WP:AN and WP:ANI (they should be on your watchlist). You'd be responding to other editors questions or problems there, much like WP:HD. WP:AIV was a good start, WP:UAA would be good as well. Getting into conversations and expressing opinions on WT:RfA. And I'd also recommend reading over the WP:ARL. I hope this helps out a bit, and don't let your recent RfA discourage you from editing the pedia, or working on becoming an admin. Best regards'' and happy editing from    

 == By way of response to all of the above == 

 All understandable, and thanks! I'm actually still glad I made a go of it. It may not have been the appropriate way to go about it, but this process has resulted in getting me a lot more info and insight, which I'll be putting to use.

And also girls seem to like it as well (I'm talking about licking them out, although I have been told that they enjoy giving head also, """"otherwise why else would (they) do it"""" - I have also been told that this only applies to big dicks...not sure on those last two (unreliable source of information = girl giving head at the time, could have just been saying it...but when your told the same thing by a number of girls, it could possibly add up to the truth)).

Bit bored by the topic now and desperately want to focus my wiki time on page creation (see List of Anglo-Saxon saints), but basically there is a tension between the forms you might expect from a superficial reading of UE guidelines, and those used by the reliable sources. Typically those who write articles in the era prefer the latter, while those brought in from process talk pages (like UE) prefer the former. No consensus on the matter has ever come about. Article titles are one thing. Different display titles are useful in different contexts. In monarch lists and more popular pages the anglicized names can be used without much difficulty; however using them in articles like this means departing from the forms used the in WP:RSs used to construct the article (as I can attest as the author) and creating serious issues of cognitive dissonance; compare this to using Gdansk in some eras but Danzig in others. We happened to have modern Anglicized names for Mael Coluim and a few famous kings, but most of the Scottish names used are ones like Garnait, Gille Chlerig and so where there is either no Anglicization or where it is so obscure as to be unhelpful. One of the routine experiences of reading about foreign societies in the distant past are unfamiliar name forms. One masters these and grows (and in any case, only a small minority of these names can ever be anglicized), and in any case I don't seriously believe the claim that 'general reader' will actually be confused.

Also, as ArnoldReinhold point out, it is quite important as a White House scandal: reneging on the 'firing' promise, apparent failure of Bush to simply ask his senior staff about their involvement, etc.  I think that aspect is at least as important as many of the Clinton scandals with daughter articles Travelgate, Filegate, Kathleen Willey, etc. 
 :2 Just merge it into the Plame article or make it into its own article (with a summary and link here).  I did that a while back with the various Clinton scandals.  Makes the Clinton article readable, and gives room for the scandal articles to grow appropriately.  
 :3 As to length implying POV, of course it doesn't indicate that; it just reflects that it has been in the news a lot recently.  That always happens for current events articles."

 Здраво, Node! I was looking for some good example of the difference between Serbian and Zlatiborian. So I decided to translate the first part of the article about English language from Wikipedia to both languages. Now, I don’t know how good you can understand the Cyrillic script, but all the different words and phrases in Zlatiborian are bold: 

 ENGLISH: 

 The English language is a West Germanic language that originated in England from Old English (Anglo-Saxon), which in turn developed from languages brought by settlers from areas in modern-northern Germany and Denmark. It is the second most common first language, with around 340 million native speakers worldwide. English has lingua franca (diplomatic language) status in many parts of the world, due to the military, economic, scientific, political and cultural influence of the United Kingdom in the 18th and 19th centuries and the United States beginning in the 20th century. It is the most widely learned second language, due largely to the former extent of the British Empire in the 19th and early 20th century and to the enormous influence the United States has exerted through radio, television, cinema, scientific publications and the Internet in recent decades. 

 History 

 English is descended from languages spoken by Germanic tribes that migrated from what is now northern Germany and perhaps Denmark to what is now England. These tribes are traditionally identified as the Frisians, Angles, Saxons, and Jutes. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, around the year 449, Vortigern, King of the British Isles, issued an invitation to the """"Angle kin"""" (Angles, led by Hengest and Horsa) to help him against the Picts. In return, the Angles were granted lands in the South-East. Further aid was sought, and in response """"came men of Ald Seaxum of Anglum of Iotum"""" (Saxons, Angles, and Jutes). The Chronicle talks of a subsequent influx of settlers who eventually established seven kingdoms. Modern scholarship considers most of this story to be legendary and politically motivated. 
 These Germanic invaders dominated the original Celtic-speaking inhabitants, whose languages survived largely in Scotland, Wales, Cornwall, and Ireland. The dialects spoken by these invaders formed what would be called Old English, which was a very similar language to modern Frisian. Later, it was also strongly influenced by the North Germanic language Old Norse, spoken by Norse who settled mainly in the North-East (see Jorvik). English, England, and East Anglia are derived from words referring to the Angles: Englisc, Angelcynn, and Engleland. 
 For the 300 years following the Norman Conquest in 1066, the Kings of England spoke only French, using it as the Court language. A large number of French words were assimilated into Old English, some words doubling with Saxon words (for instance ox and beef, sheep and mutton). The Old English also lost most of its inflections, resulting in Middle English. Around the year 1500, the Great Vowel Shift transformed Middle English to Modern English. The most famous surviving works from Old and Middle English are Beowulf and Geoffrey Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales, respectively. 
 Modern English, the language described by this article, began its rise around the time of William Shakespeare. 

 Classification and related languages 

 The English language belongs to the western sub-branch of the Germanic branch of the Indo-European family of languages. The closest living relative of English is Scots (Lallans), a West Germanic language spoken mostly in Scotland and parts of Northern Ireland. Like English, Scots is a direct descendant of Old English, also known as Anglo-Saxon. 
 After Scots, the next closest relatives are Frisian - spoken in the Netherlands and Germany - and modern Low Saxon language, spoken primarily in northern Germany. Other less closely related living languages include Dutch, Afrikaans, German and the Scandinavian languages. Many French words are also intelligible to an English speaker (pronunciations are not always identical, of course), as English absorbed a tremendous amount of vocabulary from the Norman language after the Norman conquest and from French in further centuries; as a result, a substantial share of English vocabulary is quite close to the French, with some minor spelling differences (word endings, use of old French spellings, etc.), as well as occasional differences in meaning.

То је други најкориштенији матерњи језик, са око 340 милиона корисника широм света.

 Hi, I've seen you've made several edits in the Gibraltar article. I think they are quite accurate and straight to the point, and I think I agree in general with the criteria you've applied. 

 On the other hand, I am not sure about one specific edit. You've said that mentioning a specific town as the main destination of Gibraltarians is """"superfluous"""". 

 My own opinion would be that the main destination of the massive exodus of a whole town is quite notable: Gibraltarians didn't simply vanish in the air; most of them established themselves in a very specific location called San Roque. Take into account that San Roque kept an administrative continuity with Gibraltar, all of its official records (which means that it is an important destination in order to research the History of Gibraltar pre-1704), its symbols (the banner), the largest part of the population (which means that it kept demographic continuity with pre-British Gibraltar), and is within sight of the original town (which means that there has been an important amount of interactions -both friendly and hostile- between the two sites during centuries). It has also kept a tradition of being a point of reference with regards to the culture and people of pre-British Gibraltar. 

 But I would say that the mentions in most reliable authors and sources are more important than my own opinion. Please check below a sample of mentions in the sources that are most widely used with regards to the History of Gibraltar:

It was not clear to me, when you made a comment about solemn hearings, if you were or were not suggesting that the solemnity was undesirable. """"Code Pink actions at Plame-Wilson Hearing"""" is descriptive and neutral. """"Actions"""" could include Code Pink representatives, in pink power designer suits, giving testimony to the committee. Actions could include trying to be in every view of the witness. Headings should be neutral. I disagree that """"plays heavy metal at inauguration"""" is more informative than """"actions at inaugurations"""". Headings are not expected to convey information, but to assist people in finding the informative text. In an encyclopedia, they are for indexing, not the eye-catching style of newspapers. 

 :::I will have to reread the Tierney and Perazzo articles in detail; it was not my intent to mislead. Without them in front of me, my recollection is that you are correct that Perazzo didn't directly say anything about Code Pink. What he did talk about, IIRC, was the funding of an umbrella group from which Tierney said Code Pink received funds. The article by Tierney alone was confusing; the two needed to be read together. I may have misread and I will happily say so if rereading gives me that impression. At this time, however, it is my impression that Code Pink receives funding from a source that may have a relevant ideological POV. Quoting you, """"Apparently, both Berkowitz and Tierney misstated their references in a manner prejudicial to CodePink! I'm tempted to make a sarcastic comment..."""" I'd say you did make a sarcastic comment. I hope my understanding of good faith editing is that if I found an inconsistency in your sources, I'd write something along the lines of """"A and B, quoted by Daniel, do not appear to agree with each other or the point that was put in the article. Would you mind rechecking these?""""

(from the Theatre Royal Haymarket website):  

 """"1754 saw a change of administration for the Hay Market, as the flamboyant Samuel Foote, a celebrated mimic, stepped into John Potter’s shoes. Foote’s name was to become somewhat ironic as, handed a rather frisky horse at a Royal Hunting Party as a prank, Foote was thrown from his steed, breaking his leg severely and requiring amputation. 
 Although he feared his career was over, the Hay Market was to benefit strangely from his misfortune. Horrified that the joke had so misfired, the Duke of York, a close personal friend and fellow guest at the hunt, asked if anything could be done for Foote. Immediately, Foote replied that all he wanted from life was a Royal Warrant and Patent for his ‘Little Theatre in the Hay’.""""

It's a piece of multivalent jargon and its very ambiguity has ensured its usefulness and increasing popularity. Only wish I had a source to quote for it ;-) For now, that ambiguity is simply reflected in the varying perspectives on the page."

 Your comment is very much appreciated. 

 I was probably over hasty in reverting it as vandalism, although I would suggest that it's not a good thing to change other people's self description on their own talk page. 

 But that was not what lead to my removing the self-description.  I got fed up of people telling me what they thought I ought to be like on the basis of it, and misunderstanding the self-deprecation that you recognised."
