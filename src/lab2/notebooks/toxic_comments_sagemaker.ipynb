The three main steps to this process are building locally, tagging with the repository location, and pushing the image to the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "To build the local image, call the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker build <image name>\n",
    "```\n",
    "This takes instructions from the Dockerfile we discussed earlier to generate an image on your local instance. After the image is built, we need to let our local instance of Docker know where to store the image so that SageMaker can find it. We do this by tagging the image with the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker tag <image name> <repository name>\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "<account number>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/<image name>:<tag>\n",
    "```\n",
    "Without tagging the image with the repository name, Docker defaults to uploading to Docker Hub, and not Amazon ECR. Amazon SageMaker currently requires Docker images to reside in Amazon ECR. To push an image to ECR, and not the central Docker registry, you must tag it with the registry hostname.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike Docker Hub, Amazon ECR images are private by default, which is a good practice with Amazon SageMaker. If you want to share your Amazon SageMaker images publicly, you can find more information in the Amazon ECR User Guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, to upload the image to Amazon ECR, with the Region set in the repository name tag, call the following command:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker push <repository name>\n",
    "```\n",
    "One final note on Amazon SageMaker Docker containers. We have already shown you that you have the option to build one Docker container serving both training and hosting, or you can build one for each. While building two Docker images can increase storage requirements and cost due to duplicated common libraries, you might get a benefit from building a significantly smaller inference container, allowing the hosting service to scale more quickly when reacting to traffic increases. This is especially common when you use GPUs for training, but your inference code is optimized for CPUs. You need to consider the tradeoffs when you decide if you want to build a single container or two."

Using too large learning rate may result in numerical instability especially at the very beginning of the training, where parameters are randomly initialized. The warmup strategy increases the learning rate from 0 to the initial learning rate linearly during the initial N epochs or m batches. After the learning rate warmup stage described earlier, we typically steadily decrease its value from the initial learning rate.  Compared to some widely used strategies including exponential decay and step decay, the cosine decay decreases the learning rate slowly at the beginning, and then becomes almost linear decreasing in the middle, and slows down again at the end.
