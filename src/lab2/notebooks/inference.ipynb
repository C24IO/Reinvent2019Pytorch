Instead of spending more money to meet the demand, demand is artificially lowered through denial of treatment or waiting times.  This is rationing in the normal sense of the term.  Rationing is not normally used to refer to being unable to afford certain health care services in a free market system.\n",

I checked the article on polar coordinates, and the word \"\"scalar\"\" doesn't appear there. So, what exactly IS a \"\"scalar force\"\"? And why does the article point to another article for explanation of something that isn't even mentioned in the other article? Surely something is amiss.63.24.61.29  \n",
      "Of course, you are correct in pointing out the absurdity of a \"\"scalar\"\" force. This pointer should be removed altogether, but I have only edited it to remove the absurdity.

I don't think there can be any dispute of the fact that this particular acceleration term is indeed among the terms that are called (in contemporary reputable sources) centrifugal force. Needless to say, it's entirely a matter of convention as to what names we give certain terms appearing in certain equations, but since Wikipedia articles are supposed to reflect verifiable facts from reputable sources, I can't see any justification for excluding this particular fact from the article. I think any discussion of the contemporary (let alone the historical) concept of centrifugal force is incomplete if it doesn't include this. \n",

      "There are also other concepts that go under the name \"\"centrifugal force\"\" but that are not yet mentioned in this article. And conversely, there are lots of things discussed at length in this article that are only indirectly related to the concept of centrifugal force. I understand that much of this material has been added as part of a tutorial on general physics being given to placate some of the editors here, but ultimately I think it detracts from the readibility and relevance of the article. \n",

      "Jayjg, is there any edit to this article you would accept? What are your objections to clarifying ethnic vs. religious definitions of \"\"Jews\"\"? The article is currently confusing as to which is which, and it would help to clarify that JfJ means ethnic Jews. I think in the case Mackan points out, \"\"many\"\" is appropriately used-many Jewish groups do see JfJ that way, but certainly not all (I would imagine there are plenty of Jewish groups without any official position on JfJ.) Also, most religions are rather fluid and change over time, and there is often debate over interpretation. It is, therefore, not quite so easy to state religious principles as fact (Jews don't believe in Jesus as Messiah? What about Messianic Judaism?) Of course, religious faith also tends to be given over to a lot of dogmatism (\"\"my way is the correct one\"\" type of thinking), so sometimes it's difficult to see debates to that as valid. WP:WEASEL does not object to ever using \"\"many\"\" or \"\"most\"\" or the like as qualifiers, it advocates against it only in the absence of sourcing. What we have here is a lot of sourcing, which does not, however, show that all Jews object to JfJ (as I explained above, that would be effectively impossible). It does, of course, show that \"\"many\"\" do (I wouldn't even object to \"\"almost all\"\" or \"\"most\"\"), but in order to preserve the plausibility requirement of WP:NPOV (JfJ's assertion that it is Jewish must be treated as plausible), it is impossible that all Jewish organizations disagree-as JfJ doesn't!  \"\n",

Many of their articles simply cannot be understood by a non-Jew or a non-Orthodox Jew. That is a simple fact.

I don't know if it is, if it's not OK then maybe ref delete it, but I am honestly not trying to out him.

      "Pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS) is a syndrome in which children have abrupt, dramatic onset of Tourette's Syndrome, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), or anorexia nervosa coincident with the presence of two or more neuropsychiatric symptoms.  It is believed that these children experience a rise in dopamine levels as a result of a of cross-reactive anti-neuronal antibodies triggered by streptococcal or mycoplasma infection.  The cross-reaction is believed to cause such side effects as tics.\n",

      "No.  1.  You are misreading the source.  Tics are hypothetically a feature of PANS, but you've extended that to TS, which misses the whole point of the PANS hypothesis.  PANS is hypothetically posed as a condition in which symptoms are not better explained by another condition such as Tourette's, so your text is wrong.  Second, there is exactly one paper written about PANS, it is a proposal, see WP:RECENTISM, and there is no reason to include speculative text in a Featured article.  If more papers are published, and if PANS gains some widespread medical consensus, and if secondary reviews discuss it, then you might propose accurate text here discussing the situation. I'm a bit concerned that you are editing both PANDAS and PANS, and yet your definition of the hypothetical PANS above does not seem to match the cited source, which discusses abrupt onset of OCD.  Furthermore, PANS is proposed for research purposes until there is more coverage, it doesn't belong in this (an unrelated) article.   (Talk) \n",

      " My opinions about PRT reflect the position of mainstream transit advocates in Minnesota such as the Sierra Club North Star Chapter . It is reasonable and moderate to rely on facts instead of conjecture. PRT does not exist in revenue service anywhere in the world. Any claims about PRT are merely conjecture, not fact.  Any comparisons between PRT and other proven modes of transport is meaningless, unless the purpose  is to mislead. What I have successfully proven in print and on the internet is that many PRT advocates use \"\"facts\"\" based on conjecture that PRT can out-perform conventional, existing modes of transport to argue that public funding for transit is wasteful. You can see that for yourself in this video made by a PRT advocate.. One PRT \"\"fact\"\" often repeated by advocates in public meetings is that PRT can pay for itself out of fair-box revenue - you can hear that in this video and this video. Perhaps you can find a peer-reviewed article that gives an explanation how PRT can \"\"pay for itself\"\". I have been unable to find any authoritative explanation how PRT can operate without public subsidies. Thank you.   \"\n",

The sources you linked did refer to an Iranian wine called Shiraz but doesn't specify it as being from the Syrah Grape and in fact the Hugh Johnson Vintage: Story of Wine ref does describe as the same Shirazi wine which numerous reliable sources describe as being made in Shiraz. (And if you notice, the same Story of Wine ref you added is actually already being used in the Shirazi wine article. Additionally there are numerous reliable sources in this article, including links to the DNA evidence, that conclusively show that the Syrah wine grape originated in France. No one is denying that a Shirazi wine was made in the Iranian/Persian city of Shiraz and, indeed, we have an article dedicated to the subject and make reference to that article repeatedly in the Syrah article. But the abundance of evidence shows that the Shirazi wine (which was likely made from Trebbiano) and today modern Syrahs/Shirazes are different wines. Cheese/Wine\n",

      " Scientists Discuss \"\"Evolution\"\" \n",
      "\n",
      "My attempts to demonstrate evolution by an experiment carried on for more than 40 years have completely failed. It is not even possible to make a caricature of an evolution out of paleobiological facts. The idea of an evolution rests on pure belief. (Nils Heribert Nilsson, noted Swedish botanist and geneticist, of Lund University and evolutionist).\n",
      "\n",
      "I think in fifty years, Darwinian evolution will be gone from the science curriculum. I think people will look back on it and ask how anyone could, in their right mind, have believed this, because it's so implausible when you look at the evidence. (Johnathan Wells, 'Icons of Evolution').\n",
      "\n",
      "I have come to the conclusion that Darwinism is not a testable scientific theory, but a metaphysical research program. (Karl Popper, German born philosopher of science, called by Nobel Prize winner Peter Medawar, 'Incomparably the greatest philosopher of science who has ever lived').\n",
      "\n",
      "Scientists who go about teaching that evolution is a fact of life are great con-men, and the story they are telling may be the greatest hoax ever! In explaining evolution we do not have one iota of fact. (Newton Tahmisian, Atomic Energy Commission).\n",
      "\n",
      "The pathetic thing about it is that many scientists are trying to prove the doctrine of evolution, which no science can do. (Robert A. Milikan, physicist by provision and a Nobel Prize winner, speech before the American Chemical Society).\n",
      "\n",
      "The miracles required to make evolution feasible are far greater in number and far harder to believe than the miracle of creation. (Richard Bliss, former professor of biology and science education as Christian Heritage College, It Takes a Miracle for Evolution).\n",
      "\n",
      "The only competing explanation for the order we all see in the biological world is the notion of special creation. (Colin Patterson, evolutionist and senior Paleontologist at the British Museum of Natural History, which houses more than 60.000.000 fossils).\n",
      "\n",
      "Evolution is a fairy tale for grown ups. This theory has helped nothing in the progress of science. It is useless. (Prof. Louis Bounoure, Director of Research, National Center of Scientific Research).\n",
      "\n",
      "All of us who study the origin of life find that the more we look into it, the more we feel it is too complex to have evolved anywhere. We all believe as an article of faith that life evolved from dead matter on this planet. It is just that lifes complexity is so great, it is hard for us to imagine that it did. (Dr. Harold Urey, Nobel Prize winner).\n",
      "\n",
      "A growing number of respectable scientists are defecting from the evolutionist camp, moreover, for the most part these Experts have abandoned Darwinism, not on the basis of religious faith or biblical persuasions, but on strictly scientific grounds, and in some instances, regretfully. (Dr. Wolfgang Smith, physicist and mathematician).\n",
      "\n",
      "The evolution theory is purely the product of the imagination. (Dr. Ambrose Flemming, Pres. Philosophical Society of United Kingdom).\n",
      "\n",
      "I have always been slightly suspicious of the theory of evolution because of its ability to account for any property of living beings. I have therefore tried to see whether biological discoveries over the last thirty years or so fit in with Darwins theory. I do not think that they do. To my mind, the theory does not stand up at all. (H. Lipson, A Physicist Looks at Evolution, Physic Bulletin, Page 138).\n",
      "\n",
      "The talk of evolution is sheer nonsense not founded on observation and wholly unsupported by fact. This Museum is full of proof of the utter falsity of their view. (Niles Ethredge, British Museum of Science).\n",
      "\n",
      "(Evolution is) a great cosmologic myth of the twentieth century. (Michael Denton, molecular biochemist, Evolution, Theory in Crisis).\n",
      "\n",
      "The evolutionary establishment fears creation science, because evolution itself crumbles when challenged by evidence. In the 1970s and 1980s, hundreds of public debates were arranged between evolutionary scientists and creation scientists. The latter scored resounding victories, with the result that, today, few evolutionists will debate. Isaac Asimov, Stephen Jay Gould, and the late Carl Sagan, while highly critical of creationism, all declined to debate. (James Perloff, Tornado in a Junkyard, This book was published in the year 1999, Page 241).\n",
      "\n",
      "Evolution is faith, a religion. (Louis T. More, professor of paleontology at Princeton University).\n",
      "\n",
      "Evolution is baseless and quite incredible. (John Ambrose, The Unleashing of Evolutionary Thought).\n",
      "\n",
      "Darwinism itself has become a religion. (Norman Macbeth).\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no evidence, scientific or otherwise, to support the theory of evolution. (Cecil Wakely).\n",

      "Good article, very well cited.  [User:Dick Mills]\n",
      "\n",
      "While very many people confuse the terminology for power and energy, it is particularly embarrassing to do it in an article with such a title.   The Watt is a unit of power, the rate of consumption. Power can not be consumed.  Energy, which can be consumed, is measured in watt-hours or joules. \n",
      "\n",
      "The openening sentences which say, \"\"In 2004, the worldwide energy consumption of the human race was estimated at 15 TW with 86.3% from burning fossil fuels.[1] This is equivalent to 0.5 ZJ (= 1021 J) per year.\"\" should be changed to \"\"In 2004, the worldwide energy consumption of the human race was estimated at 0.5 ZJ (=1021 J) with 86.3% from burning fossil fuels.[1]  The average rate of consumption is thus 15 TW.\"\"   \n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, the labels on the the graphs should be changed. \n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, the association of consumption with power (watts) continues throughout the article.  Again, \"\"The energy used to generate 2 TW of electricity is approximately 5 TW, as the efficiency of a typical existing power plant is around 38%.\"\" is incorrect.  One needs 5 TW of power (not energy) to create 2 TW of power at 38% efficiency. \n",
      "\n",
      "Even more unfortunate, I worry that some of the numbers are wrong because of the confusion between power and energy.  For things like wind, where a 100 MW generator operates at only 11% capacity factor, the difference between installed capacity and average production over a long period of time is 9:1.  A dominating factor.  I checked a couple of the references cited, and they too use power and energy inconsistently.  \n",
      "\n",
      "It will take a major rewrite to correct this article.  Both the nomenclature and the numbers need to be checked.  \n",

      "Thanks for your comments. I can understand how debates with people who have a fundamentalist disposition can be very frustrating and in some ways provoke a similar response. I assure I have no axe to grind on this subject. There may be ideas put forward through certain forms of creationism that I simply do not believe because it contradicts the available scientific evidence and I may find certain claims put forward as science exaggerated. It would not stop me reporting those beliefs if they represented a significant number of people or if they had a significant impact in a given society even though they were only held by a minority, albeit influential, section of the community. For example if a country has only small minority of people who believe in a literal six days account of creation yet they have an disproportionate influence on that society, for example in education, politics or the media, then I would cite the best available work(s) I know that support their idea but I would also put in the best arguments against them in a concise summary of the issue with links wherever possible to other articles that examine particular issues in more depth. I approach these kind of articles by imagining that I am an open minded reader who knows little about the subject but would like to see what the main issues are without anybody censoring or filtering out material they personally do not believe in. This imaginary reader likes to form his own opinions based on the best available information with a preference for top down structure in the article, i.e. general outlines of the issue followed by a more detailed exposition. I hope this helps you understand my outlook.  Finally I am sorry for offending you, it certainly was not intended, and if our paths ever cross on the sea be sure to say hello!\n",

The United Nations Human Rights Committee had expressed its conviction that [l]aws that penalize[d] the expression of opinions about historical facts [were] incompatible with the obligations that the Covenant [on Civil and Political Rights] impose[d] on States parties ... and that the Covenant [did] not permit general prohibition of expressions of an erroneous opinion or an incorrect interpretation of past events.ECHR ECHR punished Switzerland for criminally convicting Mr. Perinçek for publicly challenging the existence of the Armenian genocide (Perinçek said \"\"Armenian genocide is an international lie\"\").\n",

      " Questions 5 and 6 are added to establish the candidate's character for honesty.  Why this wasn't done years ago after the Archtransit scandal is hard for me to understand.  Disclosure of material negative information should be expected of all applicants.\n",

The oppose votes are disorganized insofar as oppose vote number 13 may refer back to oppose votes number 2 and 6.  The cumulative effect of oppose votes with long reasons is to say \"\"we hate you.\"\"  \n",

      "Hi, Deb. The user, CJ DUB continues to break Wiki rules by disrespecting others by insulting me. He stated the following, yet again: You are in fact ignorant. He also claims to be an editor \"\"with experience\"\". A serious wiki editor with experience does not speak so ignorantly and disrespectfully about others. A wiki editor examines facts without judging others, as is the case in discriminatory environments. Therefore, he is not a wiki editor and is most likely a poser. He seems to be a sensitive american \"\"man\"\" who feels everyone is against him or his american way of thinking. He must understand that not everyone will like him or his background. I have also noticed that another user named, Seb, may be the same person. He's probably using dual usernames in wiki. \n",

You disagree and make a counter-point.  If I am swayed by your point, I concede that your argument was stronger than mine and we move on. The reason I don't concede is that I disagree with your points.  We might agree on some level; however the point you hoped that I'd concede was central to my counter-argument. It follows that since there is little unique information in the individual articles, they should not be listed separately. If I agree with you that there is significant information in the individual articles, then it weakens my whole argument.  Maybe it's my debate background that's getting the best of me.  I'm engaging you in a debate and rather than disagreeing with me and responding, you're saying that I'm being hostile. If you consider disagreement with you \"\"hostility,\"\" I don't know where to go from there. If your intent is to sway me, you're not going to have very much luck.

      " According to Tug McGraw, one of the police horses, who lined up in the field during the 9th inning of Game 6, was not \"\"stadium trained.\"\" (8th item down the list)\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't think you can top (or is it bottom?) that for trivia. There's a simple reason that over a quarter of a century of trivia sections (and probably more) have piled up in these World Series articles: Writing well is hard work. It's just too easy to simply drop minutiae onto these pages and file them under \"\"Trivia\"\" and let somebody else do the hard work of integrating them . . . later. \n",
      "\n",
      "Part of my motivation for dredging up all those links above is that I've noticed an inconsistency of style and layout, and some confusing or redundant info in all the WS articles going back to 1903. It's like the same car built by different contractors at different times with different materials. I find it a bit troubling because it's a sign of limited effort, limited means for anybody to have developed a plan for what could be a real highlight of WP (can you say \"\"Fall Classic Portal\"\"?). I found it fairly easy to take the '06 trivia about La Russa and Leyland and create a separate section under the \"\"Background\"\" section, and it seems to have held up since Friday night. But it took some time to sift through it and move the info.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cutting to the chase: All this WS \"\"Trivia\"\" is classifiable. The better it's organized, the less it will seem like trivia, so if a handful of \"\"labels\"\" could be cooked up for categories of info formerly known as trivia, the overall style of these articles will seem to read better. That ought to settle the trivia issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Postscript: For instance, a 4-1 WS where one contender splits \"\"on the road\"\" and then comes home and sweeps to win 3 more and clinch is fairly rare from what I've looked up so far. What the Cards have done against Detroit in 2006 matches what NY (NL) accomplished in 1969 (except the Mets dropped Game 1 instead of 2 to Baltimore). I'm still working my way thru past Fall Classics to see when else this happened, so I can add this info to the '06 article in an appropriate place, but not as an addition to the dreaded Trivia section. A heading that might be appropriate for this info each and every year: Long series, short series. 4 or 5 games would classified as a short series, 6 or 7 classified as long. Easy to spot trends in this area and develop copy to fill a section like this. Was a short or long series predicted each year; by who; was a trend broken, were the prognosticators wrong, did a noted BB writer point this out so it doesn't smack of the dreaded Original Research? Now really 'nuff said.   (talk)  \"\n",

      "01. They had 11 events in 2011 and 10 in 2012. Why would you revise that number upwards? Ten seems to be a good number for a serious organization. JF is the largest organization in Brazil.\n",
      "02. Jungle Fight had exactly five title fights in 2012. Two in JF 47, two in JF 37, one in JC 36.\n",
      "03. Their events are shown on ESPN outside Brazil since JF 20. In Brazil, their events started to be shown before that.\n",
      "04. About their number of fighters, it's better if you keep the rules simple. For example, require that at least 50 fighters fought in the organization in the span of a year. What do you think about that?\n",
      "\n",
      "I know it seems weird for Jungle Fight to have the same or more points than Strikeforce, but we have other options instead of gaming the system against Jungle Fight. The current way to determine what is a top or second tier organization puts full weight on the rankings, while your system gives minimal weight to it. I think we should find a middle ground, while at the same time keep things as simple as possible. In order to do so, I would scrap criteria 3 and 8, and use a criteria based on rankings determined by Fight Matrix. That criteria could amount to 1/3 or 1/2 of all possible points. The advantages would be that the main organizations would certainly be ahead of other, while at the same time event short lived but notable organizations would have a high score. By using Fight Matrix, we would be able to easily determine how many points defunct organizations would have. Maybe we could present such a system as a possible substitute to the current way we use to determine notability?\n",

I created Breira in this vein. As I don't have the experience or expertise in Wikipedia to know what to do to best develop this idea, I figured I'd come to you for your opinions on: (1) whether it's a good idea; and (2) How to best go about implementing it.

Just think of the more recent \"\"chick flicks\"\" like Boys on the Side (arguably about failing romance but the uniting theme is their friendship), Thelma and Louise (again, female \"\"partners in crime\"\"), Riding in Cars With Boys (despite the title, the larger theme is her relationship with her father and her son, not just her boyfriend/husband), and The Women (female friendships where only one friend is truly affected by her -lack of- romantic relationship with her husband). \n",

      "I have posted nothing on the article page as this would presumably be a Conflict of Interest, and have made here suggestions of the way in which the book may be used only because requested - my view remains that it should be done by an editor who does not have COI. I think that now we've moved on from the efforts to exclude a source through (wrong) application of the Notability guidelines we're left with Neutrality of Point of View as the main issue. Wikipedia reports what is out there and a decision to exclude entirely from an article an appropriate source which has a view on much that is in the article (as well as topics the article excludes) appears to be a bias. The idea that the only book of lit crit on Beedle the Bard has nothing whatsoever to add to an encyclopaedia article on the topic is incredible. I don't think COIN is central to the issue as it now stands; rather the central issue is NPV. I think there are wider issues which it would be interesting to discuss - for example had my username not been essentially my real name a post on the talk page a year ago saying \"\"hi guys, this book exists and has something to say about the article\"\" would not have generated this negative discussion. I suggest MedCab is a way forward because it can consider all issues, while COIN considers only one issue and probably one which is not central.   \"\n",

      " This smacks of political revisionism of the worst kind; what is known in English as the Arabic Numerals are the Arabic Western Numerals, not even the Arabic Eastern Numerals. Yes, they are derived from ancient Indian numerals but nonetheless they are the Arabic Numerals. Look here, the norm is that when people in English say Arabic Numerals they are referring to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, those are the Arabic (Western) Numerals, they are not referring to १, २, ३, ४, ५, ६, ७, ८, ९, and other varities of Indian numerals, modern or ancient. They are known in English as the Arabic Numerals, that's a fact, I will not accept a revisionist statement that counters a fact so early on in the text the article, the article must start with the factual. I'll accept it under a revisionism section much later on, but it must be balanced there with opinions counter to it (counter to the counterfactual). \n",

Muslim scientists used the Babylonian numeral system, and merchants used a numeral system similar to the Greek numeral system and the Hebrew numeral system. Therefore, it was not until Fibonacci that the Arabic numeral system was used by a large population.\"\"\n",

Here's evidence that they were  The numerals though were already in wide use throughout the Arab empire, as Avicenna who was born in 980 tells in his autobiography that he learnt them, as a child, from a humble vegetable seller. He also tells that when his father, in Bukhara, was visited by scholars from Egypt in 997, including Abu Abdullah al-Natili, they taught him more about them. J J O'Connor and E F Robertson point out: He also tells of being taught Indian calculation and algebra by a seller of vegetables. All this shows that by the beginning of the eleventh century calculation with the Indian symbols was fairly widespread and, quite significantly, was known to a vegetable trader.\n",

      " \"\"The first inscriptions using 0 in India have been traced to approximately 200 CE.\"\"\n",
      " Why don't you cite reliable sources?! Here, I'll cite some: According to Professor EF Robertson and DR JJ O'Connor, \"\"The first record of the Indian use of zero which is dated and agreed by all to be genuine was written in 876\"\" on the Gwalior tablet stone. This is also verified by Professor Lam Lay Yong, an an Effective Member of the International Academy of the History of Science \"\"the earliest appearance in India of a symbol for zero in the Hindu-Arabic numeral system is found in an inscription at Gwalior which is dated 870 AD\"\". According to Menninger (p. 400): \"\"This long journey begins with the Indian inscription which contains the earliest true zero known thus far (Fig. 226). This famous text, inscribed on the wall of a small temple in the vicinity of Gvalior (near Lashkar in Central India) first gives the date 933 (A.D. 870 in our reckoning) in words and in Brahmi numerals. Then it goes on to list four gifts to a temple, including a tract of land \"\"270 royal hastas long and 187 wide, for a flower-garden.\"\" Here, in the number 270 the zero first appears as a small circle (fourth line in the Figure); in the twentieth line of the inscription it appears once more in the expression \"\"50 wreaths of flowers\"\" which the gardeners promise to give in perpetuity to honor the divinity.\"\" The Encyclopaedia Britannica says, \"\"Hindu literature gives evidence that the zero may have been known before the birth of Christ, but no inscription has been found with such a symbol before the 9th century.\"\" I'll accept mention prior to the Gwalior tablet, in fact, the article needs it and I'm planning on doing it once I'm no longer distracted by your nonsense, but such mention must be well-phrased so as not to mislead and contradict scientific consensus, and the phrasing must be limited to the exact intent of verifiable and reliable sources.  \n",

      "\n",
      "Her most substantive comments relating to the summary deletion were as follows  \n",
      "single source cited says it's not clear what even happened\n",
      "I've removed it following WP:BLP and WP:WEIGHT, given the single cited source says it's not even clear what happened, it's nothing but a non-notable, second-hand anecdote about what may or may not have been a parking lot brawl. Gwen Gale (talk) \n",
      "The grounds (as you put it) are WP:BLP. Gwen Gale (talk)  \n",
      "\n",
      "The complaint is based on five points \n",
      "1/ Gwen Gale failed to follow proper policy with regard to deleting biographical material on living persons, viz. discussing it beforehand. The section had existed for some time, had been discussed and commented on extensively, and had been edited by several persons. As far as I am aware, Gwen Gale had no prior involvement in the page or the section concerned. Certainly, I had never seen her name in any of the page history. Unless it constituted a grave breach of some other policy, which not even Gwen Gale has claimed, any possible deletion should have been discussed beforehand and not executed summarily. To quote the BLP policy  Biographical material about a living individual that is not compliant with this policy should be improved and rectified; if this is not possible, then it should be removed.\n",
      "No complaint about the nature of the material was made beforehand; no opportunity for improvement or rectification was offered. \n",
      "2/ Having failed to discuss it properly beforehand, Gwen Gale also failed to discuss it properly afterwards. She made a few general remarks, using terms which, as will be discussed later, do not form part of any Wikipedia policy, viz. single sourced, anecdotal, and breezily referred those who wanted to discuss the matter with her to general Wikipedia policy documents, such as Biography of Living Persons or Verifiability. As will be shown in what follows the text did not violate either of these policy documents. Gwen Gale refused multiple specific requests to quote the exact passages of the Biography on Living Persons or Verifiability policies which she claimed had been violated. This refusal to properly discuss a summary deletion is against Wikipedia conduct guidelines and not acceptable behaviour in an Administator.\n",
      "3/ Gwen Gales comments on the summary deletion reveal that she does not understand the core Wikipedia policy on reliable sources.\n",
      "4/ Gwen Gales comments indicate that she does not understand the proper scope of Wikipedias policy on Verifiability.\n",
      "5/ Gwen Gales comments reveal that she does not understand Wikipedias Biography on Living Persons policy. \n",
      "The only serious grounds on which deletion of the deleted text could be justified is Weight. This is not the ground on which Gwen Gale chose to defend it. She repeatedly cited BLP and V as the core defence of her actions, demonstrating that her judgement is massively flawed and that her administrative powers should be revoked. The core issue here is not the content. The core issue is Gwen Gales conduct and judgement. The Weight issue will, however, be discussed at the end.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gwen Gales Misunderstanding of the Wikipedias Guidelines on Reliable Sourcing\n",
      "It is clear that Gwen Gale does not understand Wikipedias policy on sourcing. In stating that the claims embodied in the deleted text were anecdotal, she is effectively second-guessing the judgement of the original reliable source, viz. The Austin Chronicle. She is implicitly expressing the view that the Austin Chronicles assembled journalists, editors, sub-editors and lawyers made an error in judgement in publishing the article in the first place. This is completely unacceptable and represents a FUNDAMENTAL ERROR IN JUDGEMENT. It is in no way appropriate for Wikipedia editors to make their own subjective judgements about the editorial standards of highly reputable and professional publications. It is the equivalent of an editor disputing a reference to a professional academic journal on\n",

As for the katadesmos, what is there to discuss?  I already provided a translation in English - would you like me to expand on the Grammar used?  It's interesting that you ask that the slate be cleaned.  I see nothing on my slate.  If Decius wishes to, he can start by offering apologies for calling me all these horrible insults, and most especially the \"\"weasel\"\" part, which came even after his olive branch (the hypocrisy of it!).  He should apologize earnestly, unreservedly and abjectly.  Unless he does so, I will have every right to be calling him \"\"the Window Urinator\"\" (his words, not mine).

      "In the past there was no such nation as \"\"Germany\"\". It consisted of literally hundreds of states, some kingdoms, some duchies, some simply a city. Over the centuries these states fought against each other, allied with each other, and even absorbed each other. Each state was a proper country, and so such names as \"\"Brandenburg\"\", \"\"Saxony\"\", \"\"Hanover\"\" etc defined national groupsm and cultures. It wasn't until 1871 that Gertmany became one country, and even then some regions(eg Austria) weren't invluded. Since 1871 terms like \"\"Hanoverian\"\" and \"\"Bavarian\"\" no longer refer to national identities because they're all just \"\"German\"\" or \"\"Deutsch\"\". However, if a foreign non-German people were to suddenly use the name of say 'Bavaria' as their national identity, and call their non-German language and culture \"\"Bavarian\"\" ALL Germans would take offense to it. This is something of a no-brainer. In exactly the same way, there used to be literally hundreds of separate Greek nations, varying greatly in size, power, culture, and other things. They fought both with and against eaxh other. Today however there is a single Greek state which does not include all the historical Greek lands. However if a foreign non-Greek people were to try and appropriate a regional name that is indisputably Greek(like with Nacedonia) it will understandably anger ALL Greeks. Because Macedonia was one of those hundreds of Greek regional states. What's more today more than 80 per cent of Macedon proper is within the Greek boundaries, and not FYROM's boundaries. So thus FYROM has no legitimate claim to use the name \"\"Macedonia\"\", except to describe its southern regions like Bitola and Ochrid(sp?) in a historical context....... Kurt Stein\"\n",

The premiership came down to the last match between West Perth and Rovers (not really a grand final, as it was still part of the regular fixtures), which resulted in a draw, 4.10 (WP) to 4.7 (R) – I'm guessing behinds weren't counted at this stage. Also, I think this comment pretty much confirms it: \"\"Fremantle supporters will feel very sore at not having any interest in the final match for the premiership. Really they have themselves to blame for the school-boyish behavior they have shown in ignoring the Association.\"\" Fremantle later challenged Rovers to a premiership decider under any umpire selected except Mr. Croft, which Rovers quite rightfully declined to take part in. Very interesting reading, and that's my historical research finished for the day ) ♦A \n",

      "Another thought - is describing the word as a \"\"neologism\"\" superfluous, perhaps? I've always been an advocate of approaching writing a Wikipedia article as if everything you're writing about happened a thousand years ago and is ancient history, because it seems to me that's the proper style for an encyclopaedia, which is intended to be timeless and authoritative. \"\"Neologism\"\" is an inescapably relative word - *all* words are neologisms looked at from one perspective in time, soon after they are invented. (All the words Shakespeare invented would be neologisms if you lived in 1630, for instance). I sincerely hope this page will be around in some form in another hundred years, at which point homophobia will no longer be a neologism. I think it's probably sufficient simply to say when and by whom the term was coined. Comments? AW\"\n",

This has been discussed here and elsewhere, including talk pages linked to from this section (that is, #Iran).

      "Mees' breakthrough as an opinion writer in the Netherlands came in 2006 when she wrote The time is long overdue that women should go to work.[8] That same year, she co-founded Women on Top, an organization that until 2011 advocated more women in top jobs.[9] \n",
      "From 2006 to 2010 Mees wrote a bi-weekly column in NRC Handelsblad, and from 2012 to 2013 for Het Financieele Dagblad. Her work has been published in the Financial Times, Foreign Policy and other international newspapers. Currently she is a columnist for Project Syndicate[11] and the German magazine Capital. Mees is the author of three books. \n",
      "Mees has been president of the New York chapter of the Dutch Labour Party (PvdA) in New York. In 2008, she worked as a volunteer for the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton.[12]\n",
      "In August 2012, Mees completed a doctoral thesis at the Erasmus School of Economics, focusing on the effect of China's economy on the emergence of the 2008 global financial crisis.[13] While completing her research, she worked as an Adjunct Assistant Professor at Tilburg University.[14] From September 2012 until July 2013, Mees was employed as an Adjunct Associate Professor of Public Administration at New York University's Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service.[15]\n",
      "In July 2013, Mees was arrested in New York on charges of stalking her former lover, the chief economist of Citigroup, Willem Buiter.[16] In March 2014, the court decided that the case against Mees was to be dismissed in one year provided that she complies with two conditions.[17]\n",

If you haven't noticed, a few of their cousins C40LF buses were at the same division they were, since one 5300 series bus was on line 180 in the early 2000s, when it was brand new.

      "Krishnendu das aka Babukishan comes from an old and very traditional Baul folklore family. His grandfather, Guru Shri Nabani Das Baul, was a much celebrated singer and poet that was instrumental in bringing the Baul culture to fame with the respected and admired status it enjoys today. Nabani Das Baul often collaborated with the writer of India's National Anthem, a great poet, and winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1913, Rabindranath Tagore. In popularizing the music of the Baul. \n",
      "\n",
      "Nabani Das Baul opened the doors for his people to the world. In keeping with this tradition. Babukishan's father, Samrat Purna Das Baul, a modern, popular legend among the Bauls, opened up the doors even further by collaborating and jamming in live performances with the top Western and European acts of the 20th century. Babu is a music designer, singer, and author renowned in India for his work in both the recording and film industries. He plays a variety of music combining new age, and world fusion, with traditional folk music in authentic Bengali Baul style\n",
      "Babukishan began his career as a performer by accompanying and studying the arts with his father, Purna das Baul. He also participated in numerous youth folk festivals, traveling to places such as Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Bangkok, Great Britain, all of Europe, the United States, and Canada. He played with both the Asian Performing Arts Festival at the Royal Albert Hall in London and the Worldwide Youth Festival in Carnegie Hall in New York.\n",
      "\n",
      "From this beginning, he traveled most of the world from 1980 to 2000 as a composer, music instructor,musician. and singer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Babukishan, deeply inspired by his Father and Grandfather, knew at an early age he too wished to compose and perform. He began on the soil of Bengal but clearly he was destined to belong to the world of music. His journey started in early childhood when he joined his mother, Manju Das, and his father, Puma Das, playing and singing Baul music in global festivals. Despite the many world tours, Babu also found the time to study Indian philosophy and Folk music at the University of Kolkata where he eventually secured both his BA and Masters degrees. \n",
      "\n",
      "So it was that his formal professional career in music began with his family. He toured with Bob Dylan's The Band East & West tour in 1985. In addition, Babukishan has performed with other international artists such as Alice Cooper, Rolling Stones,Tom Petty, Miles Davis, Allan Fakir, George Harrison, Herbie Mann, Third World, Robbie Robertson, Garth Hudson and many others. \n",
      "\n",
      "Though the subsequent years, Babu put this solid foundation in music to good use by composing and performing in all areas of India's entertainment industry as well as in a variety of venues worldwide. Then, in keeping with his early dreams of a unique style of his own, he turned to the music of the western world that he had become so familiar with in his early years of performance. His use of Baul & Indian rhythms combined with the Reggae produced his own brand of World Music-Babu's New Age, Bengali Folk Fusion is the result. \n",
      "\n",
      "Babukishan has also worked with top Indian musicians/singers and music directors such as R.D.Burman, Ravi Shankar, Sultan Khan and Zakir Hussain. \n",
      "\n",
      "As a composer, Babukishan has written the music for several albums, TV serials and films, earning a good reputation as one of the most promising composer in the Bollywood (Indian cinema) music & film industry of India. In his recordings, Babukishan features folk music, romantic songs, pop songs, ghazals, Qawwali music, new age, fusion, Sufi music and bhajans (devotional/spiritual songs). He is the first singer and music composer from the rich Baul family tradition to venture into fusion music by combining Baul/Sufi music with western music and reggae music. Babukishan produced and directed two documentary films about folk music and he wrote a book titled The Bauls of Bengal. One of Babukishan's latest projects is the band \"\"Birds\"\", which he founded. It combines new age, world music/traditional folk and fusion music. His album Soulmate\"\" (Universal/Music India) creates a unique new generation music worldwide.and his latest album, Birds & soul mind & body are based on Baul/Sufi music.\"\"GYPSYINDIA\"\" is authentic traditional baul & sufi music written/composed and all the instruments played by him.this album recored at woodstock,newyork during his tour on 2004.\n",

      "Hi. Thank you for the good faith improvements made to Washington, D.C.. However, the changes have been mostly reverted for the following reasons:\n",
      "All new information must have sources that correspond with WP:CITE.\n",
      "Per WP:SUMMARY, the main article on Washington, D.C. provides only a summary of information and does not go into very many specifics, unless it is considered to be a \"\"major\"\" aspect of the city. Since hurricanes and noreasters are rare, they are only mentioned in passing. In our efforts to maintain Washington D.C.'s Featured Article status, the editors typically revert edits that would expand the information beyond what is required by WP:SUMMARY. Along these lines, storms that have hit D.C. are not mentioned because A) there is already a subpage on the subject (List of Maryland and Washington, D.C. hurricanes (1980–present)) and B) since we can't mention every storm, we mention none of them. It is also the reason \"\"noreasters\"\" aren't defined in detail, because there is already an article devoted to them, which users can read to find more information.\n",
      "The article is on Washington, D.C. itself, not the surrounding area. Therefore, any information about what happens in the suburbs or the nearby coastal areas is not included in this article.\n",

      "\n",
      "Hanssen was born in Chicago, Illinois, to a family of mixed Danish-Polish and German descent. His father, a Chicago police officer, was emotionally abusive to Hanssen during his childhood.[7] Once, for no known reason, Howard Hanssen arranged for his son to fail a driver's test. In later life, Robert Hanssen speculated that his father had done this in order to 'toughen him up'. The elder Hanssen constantly disparaged his son and said that Robert would never make anything of his life.[8]\n",
      "\n",
      "Hanssen graduated from William Howard Taft High School in 1962 and went on to attend Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois, where he earned a bachelor's degree in chemistry in 1966. While at Knox, he took an interest in Russian through elective courses. It was also at this time when Hanssen applied for a cryptographer position in the NSA but was rebuffed due to budget setbacks. Originally set to become a doctor, Hanssen took the opportunity to enroll in the dental school at Northwestern University.[9] He did well academically, but said that he \"\"didn't like spit all that much\"\".[10] He switched his focus to business after three years,[11] and received an MBA in accounting and information systems in 1971. After graduating, he took a job with an accounting firm but quit to join the Chicago Police Department as an internal affairs investigator, specializing in forensic accounting. Hanssen left the department after two years, joining the FBI in January 1976.[7]\n",
      "\n",
      "Hanssen met Bernadette \"\"Bonnie\"\" Wauck while he was attending dental school in Chicago. Bonnie was one of eight children from a staunchly Roman Catholic family. The couple married in 1968. After Hanssen married, he converted from Lutheranism to his wife's Catholicism, becoming a fervent believer and being extensively involved in Opus Dei.\n",
      "[edit] Early FBI career and first espionage activities (1979–1981)\n",
      "\n",
      "Hanssen joined the FBI as a special agent on 12 January 1976 and was transferred to the field office in Gary, Indiana. In 1978, Hanssen and his growing family (of three children and eventually six) moved to New York when the FBI transferred him to its field office there.[12] The next year, Hanssen was moved into counter-intelligence and given the task of compiling a database of Soviet intelligence for the Bureau. It was then, in 1979, only three years after joining the FBI, that Hanssen began his career as a Soviet, and later a Russian, spy.\n",
      "\n",
      "That year, Hanssen approached the GRU (the Soviet military intelligence agency) and offered his services. Hanssen never indicated any political or ideological motive for his activities, telling the FBI after he was caught that his only motivation was the money.[13] During his first espionage cycle, Hanssen told the GRU a significant amount, including information on FBI bugging activities and Bureau lists of suspected Soviet intelligence agents. His most important leak of information was the betrayal of Dmitri Polyakov, code named TOPHAT. Polyakov was a CIA informant for more than twenty years before his retirement in 1980, and passed enormous amounts of information to American intelligence while he rose to the rank of General in the Soviet Army. For unknown reasons, the Soviets did not act on their intelligence about Polyakov until he was betrayed a second time by CIA mole Aldrich Ames in 1985. Polyakov was arrested in 1986 and executed in 1988. Ames was officially blamed for giving Polyakov's name to the Soviets, but Hanssen's role remained unknown until after his arrest in 2001.[14]\n",
      "\n",
      "Hanssen was nearly exposed in 1981, when Bonnie Hanssen caught her husband in their basement writing a letter to the Soviets. Hanssen admitted to her that he'd been giving information to the Soviets (motivated purely by his \"\"need\"\" for money) and that he had received US$30,000 as payment, but he lied and said that he was only passing along false intelligence. Knowing this, Bonnie insisted that her husband go to confession, as is required in the Roman Catholic faith for those who have committed serious sins. The Opus Dei priest who allegedly heard Robert's confession is said to have told him to give the money to charity as an act of penance. This remains unconfirmed as under the Seal of Confession, it is absolutely forbidden for a confessor to betray in any way a penitent in words or in any manner for any reason\"\" (Canon 983.1) under penalty of \"\"latae sententiae excommunication (Canon 1388.1). Hanssen told his wife that he gave the money to Mother Teresa, but it is unknown if he actually did so.[15] Hanssen then stopped spying for the Soviet Union until 1985.\n",

What rule are your referring to?  To the best of my knowledge all the written rules are exactly the same in all courts for both pro ses and attorney except for 1.) ECF, which pro ses are frequently not allowed to use, 2.) pro se forms, which  pro ses aren't required to use.  An attorney could probably use the pro se forms if they wanted. 3.) appellate appendixes  in pro se cases the entire case file is sent over and there is no provision for joint appendixes, a disadvantage for pro ses.  There are also other procedures for pro ses, which are not in the rulessee the appellate procedures which I quoted from the case manuals. As I read the California manual, it seemed merely to instruct the judges to provide more explanation.

There is certainly no evidence of holiday to be of persian, iranian or zoroastrian origin. I goes back to the Sumerian festival of Akitu (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akitu). Persians came to the plato along with other iranian speakers after the ancient civilisations were already established there. Aryans certainly changed the name of many geographic locations including the names of holidays.

I'm also happy that someone has finally added something to the portal, because most of the time it's just me maintaining it, so I may inadvertently bias the portal towards my personal preferences.

      "\n",
      "Previous versions of this article unnecessarily multiplied references to criticism of the New Family Structures Study. \n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, this article is ostensibly about the Witherspoon Institute, not the New Family Structures Study, and it does not make sense to devote so much space to one study in what is otherwise a small article about an organization that has done many other things, as mentioned in the earlier paragraphs. \n",
      "\n",
      "Further, there is already a reference to the fact that the Study received criticism, down toward the end of the article. That same sentence also refers to the fact that many scholars also voiced praise for the Study, and thereby gives much more balance than the earlier discussion of criticism.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fact remains that the Study was published by a peer-reviewed journal and was conducted at a major research university that has not condemned it. Some people voiced concerns to the same university that the study had not been conducted properly and the university found that the concerns did not merit further scrutiny. This Study has received the same vetting that countless other academic studies have received, including ones that came to very different conclusions.\n",
      "\n",
      "In short, previous representations of criticism in this article about this Study were unnecessarily long, presented the Study in a very biased light, and made this article into a forum for voicing opinions that is properly handled in the academy through the methods of peer review and institutional review that the Study already passed. By ignoring those very processes of review such discussion does a disservice to Wikipedia's readers and suggests that the critics have a problem with the academic review processes as such, not the New Family Structures Study itself.\n",

Unfortunately, however, this is an example of exactly the kind of thing which Wikipedia does not do, and it conflicts with several of Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. You are clearly intending to use Wikipedia to host a page about a product to publicise it. Whether the motivation behind doing this is to increase profits of the company making that product or \"\"for the good cause of the women in India\"\" is irrelevant: Wikipedia is not for use to promote anything for any purpose. To put the same thing another way, the policy that Wikipedia is not for promotion applies just as much to promotion of good causes as it does to promotion of business interests. Trying to increase awareness of health issues in a population where there is widespread ignorance of those issues is no doubt a worthwhile thing to do, but it is not one of the things that Wikipedia does.\n",
      "\n",
      "You should also be aware that editing on behalf of a business or organisation to write about a subject in which that business or organisation has a direct interest is brings you into conflict with Wikipedia's conflict of interest guidelines. A Wikipedia article needs to be written from a neutral point of view, and if you are writing on behalf of someone else in order to publicise a subject they are involved with, it is likely that you will find it difficult or impossible to write from such a neutral point of view. (In fact, in this case it is clear that you do not even wish to write from a neutral point of view, since your declared aim is to portray the campaign as a good thing.)\n",

      "\"\"Stayfree India\"\" has used several Wikipedia accounts, which have been blocked from editing, because their only purpose was using Wikipedia to promote their cause. They have evidently approached you to edit on their behalf, to continue the attempt to promote their cause. Under Wikipedia's policy on  abuse of multiple accounts, if any account is used to make edits on behalf of a blocked editor, thereby helping the blocked editor to evade the block, the account used for such purposes can be blocked too, as it is being used to circumvent Wikipedia's policies. As I said at the beginning of this message, I have no doubt that you are acting in good faith, and that is why I have taken the time and trouble to explain to you what the issues are, rather than simply blocking your account. You are welcome to contribute to Wikipedia on other topics, where you do not have a conflict of interest, would not be helping to evade blocks on other accounts, and would not be promoting a cause. However, continuing to edit in ways which conflicts with Wikipedia's policies in those respects will not be acceptable.   \"\n",

Hrafn has a Richard Dawkins' anti-Christian POV filling many articles with secular fascism similar to 1935 Germany. This time it is against Christians. Godwin has his law, saying that such a comment creates a losing argument. Again, the connection (funding) from Homeland Security / Defense to WP /GOOGle, using US Treasury money to ban free speech on WP is Sedition of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.

It is you and you little clique that are trying to impose on people there view of where people live. You want to label one set of Cumbrians are Westmorlanders because at some point in the past HMG created an area and named in Westmorland, which it has now abolished and some people still wish to use the old mode. No one has held a public vote the only things that matters in this is what HMG has said. Most people in Merseyside I identify more strongly with Merseyside than any other county, that is there identity. I have seen no evidence other than that 2 pressure groups want to enforce there view. The flag did not belong to the County When is existed, it hasn't been created for or by an organisation with any mandate. I know people who live in all parts of Cumbria and never has one of the refereed to Westmorland or Cumberland in any context in the past or present. It is some fantasy of yours that you speak for the majority of several areas without showing any evidence or having any mandate. I suspect you rather old and stuck in your ways and can't abide change and that this is what is atthe root of you misguided POV.

Do you have anyone who knows you waste your life like this?  Please don't be offended.  But please just stop.  You have a very serious illness.

Mutual masturbation is actually handjob and fingering, which of course is non-penetrative sex, not masturbation! Mutual masturbation is not about two people sitting opposite to each other and masturbating without touching one another, this is nonsense! If no contact exists, this is simple masturbation, no matter how close two persons are to each other. No contact = Masturbation.

Maybe also, (although controversial as to what to list) the page could summarise the influential films for that country in a concise list of around top 10-30 films of notability or really made an impact on culture?? But then I guess that's what the cinema of Australia article is for... yeah I'm not sure about that particular title, but I think it might be better to steer it into something... Maybe it should just be a disambiguation page and the links and resources might be better suited on the Cinema of Australia page?? \"\n",

      "Russell was active in the Fabian socialist movement.  His political thought was certainly very sympathetic to many technocratic ideas, but was generally more abstract than any ideology.  Roads to Freedom makes patent his political promiscuity: Russell was willing to support any movement that would tend to push history towards human freedom, humane social relations, and the rational satisfaction of human needs.  (Although when nuclear war was concerned, he seemed to prefer social injustice to complete ruin).  On the other hand, Russell was deeply skeptical of technology and science in its influence on human society and culture.  The Scientific Outlook was his vision of a scientific dystopia—one which incorporates much of technocracy.  (For the uninitiated: it is somewhat similar to Brave New World).  Although the technocratic elements are not necessarily portrayed in a negative light, they are not left blameless for the resulting society.  All in all, it seems hard to imagine that book could be the work of an enthusiastic technocrat. — 06:39, 27 January 2007\n",

      "\"\"No one realized that lives had been lost until later that night, when firefighters searching one of the burnt-out trailers discovered the bodies, thought at first to be mannequins.\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This is not true. This was reported in our local papers as well. The night of the fire, the media were told almost nothing, and had to go by rumor. I spoke to the fire chief, as well as numerous others on the scene that night. You see, except for the extreme rear portions of the back of the trailers, where the walls were not made of plywood, everything except metal had been disintegrated to ash. The bodies were discovered before dark, as soon as the fire was extinguished, not much later in the night.\n",
      "The firefighters knew that what they were dealing with were human remains: bones, blood, jewelry and even unburned clothes and wallets inside pockets on those insulated on the bottom of the pile. (I've seen the photos) Additionally, the stench of burned flesh was overpowering, being noticed by patrons exiting the park from the main exit, separated only by a chain link fence from the Haunted Castle trailers. Wax mannequins would have been long-since melted. \n",
      "The truth is that the management at first claimed (and might have believed) to firefighters that they had evacuated all patrons from the HC, and there was no reason to close the park. The  castle was isolated, so the fire couldn't spread to other buildings. The fire was out by 7:45, and the park closed at 8:00 p.m. I've never heard of SFGA kicking everybody of the park during an otherwise fairly busy night, with fair weather with a free return pass. An unprecedented decision was made and implemented in 15 minutes. Given this time frame, they clearly found the bodies instantly, and there wasn't time to think that they were \"\"mannequins\"\".    \n",
      "\n",
      "\"\"Eight days after the fire, a statement by the Ocean County Prosecutor's Office said a 13-year-old boy had called the police after hearing radio reports that investigators were looking for witnesses. The boy told the police that he had been befriended by a 14-year-old boy at the castle's entrance. He said the older youth, who appeared to be familiar with the castle, offered to guide him through. He said the older youth used a cigarette lighter to find his way down a long corridor that was dark because of a malfunctioning strobe light, and eventually bumped into and ignited a foam-rubber wall pad. The prosecutor exonerated the older youth, who has never been identified, of any criminal wrongdoing.\"\"\n",
      "Police knew the identities of both boys by very early the next morning, and interviewed both Saturday May 12th.  The younger boy's parents had called authorities without being prompted by any radio broadcast. The older boy was turned in by his teacher, who had seen him unattended, exit a burning Haunted Castle, and alerted police as soon as he could. This boy set numerous fires. Bumping up against the strobe pad could not have accidentally ignited it. Try to reproduce such a thing. It takes about 30 seconds to set fire to polyurethane foam. It is unclear why the prosecutor didn't go after him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"\"According to news reports of the trial, no such boy was ever found, and no other witness testified to seeing such a boy. Under cross-examination by the defense, the witness denied starting the fire himself.\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Although its true as it is quote from the article, the identity of the boy was well known to investigators.\n",
      "\n",
