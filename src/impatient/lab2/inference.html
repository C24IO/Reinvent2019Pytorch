/* This file is a compatability layer.  It allows the usage of flexible box 
model layouts accross multiple browsers, including older browsers.  The newest,
universal implementation of the flexible box model is used when available (see
`Modern browsers` comments below).  Browsers that are known to implement this 
new spec completely include:

    Firefox 28.0+
    Chrome 29.0+
    Internet Explorer 11+ 
    Opera 17.0+

Browsers not listed, including Safari, are supported via the styling under the

Japanese article / Merging two articles 
The Japanese version of this article talks about both Golden Sun titles, instead of just the first title of the series.  Shouldn&#39;t both English articles about both titles be merged together? I believe this will help raise the priority.  Also, why not send a translator to find information in the Japanese article that the English one lacks?

Health care is rationed in the United States.  This happens in public hospitals that provide care for the uninsured and those patients participating in socialized systems such as Medicare and Medicaid.  For example, there is a greater demand for dialysis, Xigirs, colonoscopies, and new technologies like HeartMate than what is being supplied to these patients.  Instead of spending more money to meet the demand, demand is artificially lowered through denial of treatment or waiting times.  This is rationing in the normal sense of the term.  Rationing is not normally used to refer to being unable to afford certain health care services in a free market system.

Peer Review 

While a peer review would help, I doubt that the article would pass a GAN. It simply isn&#39;t there yet. The unsourced information would definitely be pointed out. I think a more appropriate move would to get it listed into the proper projects and then have it assessed. Then, after that. I think a GAN would be a wonderful move.  Speak Page

 What is a &#34;&#34;scalar force&#34;&#34;?  

At the start of the current article there appears a list of pointers to other article, and the last item on the list says &#34;&#34;For the scalar force that appears in polar coordinates, see the article on polar coordinates&#34;&#34;. I checked the article on polar coordinates, and the word &#34;&#34;scalar&#34;&#34; doesn&#39;t appear there. So, what exactly IS a &#34;&#34;scalar force&#34;&#34;? And why does the article point to another article for explanation of something that isn&#39;t even mentioned in the other article? Surely something is amiss.63.24.61.29  
Of course, you are correct in pointing out the absurdity of a &#34;&#34;scalar&#34;&#34; force. This pointer should be removed altogether, but I have only edited it to remove the absurdity. The history of this article shows that this pointer was a concession to a long, drawn out battle that apparently exhausted all parties and led to this compromise.   
Any single dimension is a scalar- a scalar is simply a single number. There&#39;s nothing absurd about a scalar force any more than there is about a scalar acceleration. What is 9.81 m/s^2?- () WolfKeeper (Talk) 

I don&#39;t understand the &#34;&#34;corrected&#34;&#34; version. The acceleration component that it refers to (i.e., the one that arises in stationary polar coordinates) is explicitly described and given the name &#34;&#34;centrifugal force&#34;&#34; in countless reputable references, including:

(1) &#34;&#34;An Introduction to the Coriolis Force&#34;&#34; By Henry M. Stommel, Dennis W. Moore, 1989 Columbia University Press. 
(2) &#34;&#34;Methods of Applied Mathematics&#34;&#34; By Francis B. Hildebrand, 1992, Dover, p 156.
(3) &#34;&#34;Statistical Mechanics&#34;&#34; By Donald Allan McQuarrie, 2000, University Science Books. 
(4) &#34;&#34;Essential Mathematical Methods for Physicists&#34;&#34; By Hans-Jurgen Weber, George Brown Arfken, Academic Press, 2004, p 843.

 This has been pointed out previously, with the relevant quotations. I don&#39;t think there can be any dispute of the fact that this particular acceleration term is indeed among the terms that are called (in contemporary reputable sources) centrifugal force. Needless to say, it&#39;s entirely a matter of convention as to what names we give certain terms appearing in certain equations, but since Wikipedia articles are supposed to reflect verifiable facts from reputable sources, I can&#39;t see any justification for excluding this particular fact from the article. I think any discussion of the contemporary (let alone the historical) concept of centrifugal force is incomplete if it doesn&#39;t include this. 

There are also other concepts that go under the name &#34;&#34;centrifugal force&#34;&#34; but that are not yet mentioned in this article. And conversely, there are lots of things discussed at length in this article that are only indirectly related to the concept of centrifugal force. I understand that much of this material has been added as part of a tutorial on general physics being given to placate some of the editors here, but ultimately I think it detracts from the readibility and relevance of the article. 

Overall I think the present article has evolved into a lengthy set of notes that various people have made as they clarified in their own minds certain aspects and implications of the centrifugal force, as they responded to challenges from certain other editors. Sort of learning on the job. That&#39;s a commendable exercise, but it doesn&#39;t make for a very coherent article, and frankly, the

I was quite disturbed to see that you carelessly erased large sections of my work without any discussion with me beforehand. Among other things, I had been adding large numbers of new references to the Freddie Mercury page. As your carelessness here has cost me about 20 mintues of my time, there is no doubt that you are acting as the vicious vandal here. I recommend that you discuss major edits with others before making them. Moreover, I hope that you will refrain from making further edits until I am finished tonight.

How is the reader to know that we are showing this image because we think its existence somehow proves something about societal attitudes - and we don&#39;t even indicate what it proves.  Also, we have no idea if that picture was hidden away for hundreds of years.  The fact that it exists doesn&#39;t really prove anything.

The real problem is the set up for GOT wiki characters.  Almost unprecedented, TV viewers don&#39;t want to be subject to the &#39;spoilers&#39; from the books.  If there&#39;s a possibility they will, they won&#39;t click on the wiki link.   So just a plain Jon Snow description doesn&#39;t say if it&#39;s from the book or TV or both.    Really, you should have two separate descriptions (&#34;&#34;Jon SnowTV series&#34;&#34; and &#34;&#34;Jon Snowcharacter in a Song of Ice and Fire series&#34;&#34;), such as exist in long running TV or movies series sometimes when they are not exactly the same as the book series.

Jayjg, is there any edit to this article you would accept? What are your objections to clarifying ethnic vs. religious definitions of &#34;&#34;Jews&#34;&#34;? The article is currently confusing as to which is which, and it would help to clarify that JfJ means ethnic Jews. I think in the case Mackan points out, &#34;&#34;many&#34;&#34; is appropriately used-many Jewish groups do see JfJ that way, but certainly not all (I would imagine there are plenty of Jewish groups without any official position on JfJ.) Also, most religions are rather fluid and change over time, and there is often debate over interpretation. It is, therefore, not quite so easy to state religious principles as fact (Jews don&#39;t believe in Jesus as Messiah? What about Messianic Judaism?) Of course, religious faith also tends to be given over to a lot of dogmatism (&#34;&#34;my way is the correct one&#34;&#34; type of thinking), so sometimes it&#39;s difficult to see debates to that as valid. WP:WEASEL does not object to ever using &#34;&#34;many&#34;&#34; or &#34;&#34;most&#34;&#34; or the like as qualifiers, it advocates against it only in the absence of sourcing. What we have here is a lot of sourcing, which does not, however, show that all Jews object to JfJ (as I explained above, that would be effectively impossible). It does, of course, show that &#34;&#34;many&#34;&#34; do (I wouldn&#39;t even object to &#34;&#34;almost all&#34;&#34; or &#34;&#34;most&#34;&#34;), but in order to preserve the plausibility requirement of WP:NPOV (JfJ&#39;s assertion that it is Jewish must be treated as plausible), it is impossible that all Jewish organizations disagree-as JfJ doesn&#39;t!  &#34;

The original velocity posted 14 Nov 2001 didn&#39;t have either feet per second or meters per second, just &#34;&#34; Velocity: 27,875 kph (17,321 mph)&#34;&#34;, numbers which remained until Dink87522&#39;s edit.  So the 7,643 should have been 7,743, and it was here that way by the time this was split from Space Shuttle Program.  That 27,875 km/h = 7743+ m/s = 25,404 ft/s, but probably not to that precision.   &#34;

Huh, I plotted the CIE data and it&#39;s indeed rather different. Reading the reference I got my graph from, it seems its data comes directly from spectrophotometry of the cone cells themselves, but says that there&#39;s a whole bunch of processing that goes on after that, in the retinal membrane and the brain. This colour vision stuff is more complex that it looks.

P.s, the delta function I use in the example above as  is the Kronecker delta, not the Dirac delta. The Kronecker delta is in , whereas the Dirac delta is not in L2[0,1].

Incidentally, in response to the request for examples, L2(X) is not a RKHS for X any open subset of . On the other hand, Hardy spaces usually are RKHSs, using various variants of the Szego kernel.

For example , the Hilbert space of L2 functions on the circle is not a RKHS. On the other hand, , the space of L2 functions on the circle which are tangential limits of holomorphic functions on the disc, is.  14:18

To add, a centrally-maintained list reduces the maintenance burden quite considerably and effectively insures that changes will be propagated to all categories. Considering that R templates are somewhat unstable, I think the use of the navbox is judicious.

 I have thought about it, and, yes, you are completely correct. I have to apologize for having been so mistaken.  No reasonable person could construe you saying &#34;&#34;Admin? I thought his behavior was more inline with that of a troll&#34;&#34; could ever in any way implicate even suggestively to my being a troll.

Non-involved people most definitely cannot understand Yeshivish. A nice example of Yeshivish is the English Yated Neeman, which can be found online at http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com . Many of their articles simply cannot be understood by a non-Jew or a non-Orthodox Jew. That is a simple fact. It is 99% English, but those few Hebrew (and Aramaic and Yiddish) words mixed in make many articles totally unreadable for the average person. I removed the disputed tag. It has been there for months and barely anything was done about the article since, so I presumed it was safe to remove it.  | (talk)

Certainly it makes sense, if it isn&#39;t published it isn&#39;t presentedable in Wikipedia.  A good lesson to keep in mind for those who support citing unpublished, confidential documents ).

I suspect it&#39;s more a case of a descriptor - we might call him an Independent Democrat, I guess, but that would be pushing it. It&#39;s a bit like how people ran as &#34;&#34;Independent Liberals&#34;&#34; when there was no actual &#34;&#34;Liberal Party&#34;&#34;. I think Independent is fine.

Apparently the holotype and a few potential referred specimens are housed at the AMNH:  News story about it here, maybe we could incorporate some of this into the article . I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s on display or not, or if any of the various small NJ museums would have casts or something.

Namemove
This was moved from Alex Jones (journalist) to Alex Jones (radio). i object to this. It should be Alex Jones, period, since he is the most known Alex Jones. See article Ali, Umar and Muhammad, we dont have Muhammad (prophet). Also, changing from &#34;&#34;Journalist&#34;&#34; to &#34;&#34;Radio&#34;&#34; is impiying he is not known as a Journalist, but rather as a radio perosnality, and that is false. A bad faith move in my view. &#34;

EDIT: Is it OK to link this? I&#39;m asking because I now realized it shows his place of being. I found this via Google search looking at his political background checks and stumbled across this site via governmental searches to improve the article. I don&#39;t know if it is, if it&#39;s not OK then maybe ref delete it, but I am honestly not trying to out him. Anyway, I haven&#39;t read the article itself yet( I was going to afterwords) but I wanted to know if it was OK to insert this.(OK I just read it and it doesn&#39;t say anything about it) so if this is OK, maybe. My gut feeling it&#39;s not OK, but I wanted to know if it was so I took it to the talk page. If anyone thinks it&#39;s not, then edit out the link.

Right after your question archived (I think it&#39;s set for 7 days on WP:RDMA) the Daily Telegraph reader opened a new section with their answer.  I added links to each section pointing to the other, and also added a link to your user page in the new section in an effort to call it to your attention (as I think such an action was supposed to generate a notification).  The new section just archived, so I updated the link to it from the old section, and at the same time noticed that you hadn&#39;t chimed in, prompting my note.
There is some discussion in new section about whether, under any calendar, two consecutive Feb 29 full moons would ever occur exactly 823 years apart, but whatever the spread, the average number will be close enough to 823 years that it seems very likely to be the source of the story you read.  ToE

If yes, TGD article already mentions it  the two actually have linked runways (by a long taxiway) and should be considered a single airport. In this case, this article just introduces noice w/o adding any value/content.

As a current Camp Fire USA leader, I would like to add that Camp Fire USA is very much individual from Council to Council, and National requires very little be adhered to - but the &#39;Worship God&#39; is still very much a part of the Camp Fire Law.
Just as some folks do choose to say the Pledge of Allegiance without the words &#39;under God&#39; so too do some Councils ignore the &#39;official&#39; wording of the Camp Fire Law.
This does NOT mean that Camp Fire Law does not contain the words, only that those who wish to abstain may do so.

With Piotrus&#39;s excellent work, I agree that it is notable  he demonstrated that it has at least two notable members.  And as to Polish awards  yes, I would also think that in general they should count, if they are on the level of the US Grammys and the like (lower level music awards would not).  Best.

 Edit request on 26 February 2012 

Pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS) is a syndrome in which children have abrupt, dramatic onset of Tourette&#39;s Syndrome, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), or anorexia nervosa coincident with the presence of two or more neuropsychiatric symptoms.  It is believed that these children experience a rise in dopamine levels as a result of a of cross-reactive anti-neuronal antibodies triggered by streptococcal or mycoplasma infection.  The cross-reaction is believed to cause such side effects as tics.

  
No.  1.  You are misreading the source.  Tics are hypothetically a feature of PANS, but you&#39;ve extended that to TS, which misses the whole point of the PANS hypothesis.  PANS is hypothetically posed as a condition in which symptoms are not better explained by another condition such as Tourette&#39;s, so your text is wrong.  Second, there is exactly one paper written about PANS, it is a proposal, see WP:RECENTISM, and there is no reason to include speculative text in a Featured article.  If more papers are published, and if PANS gains some widespread medical consensus, and if secondary reviews discuss it, then you might propose accurate text here discussing the situation. I&#39;m a bit concerned that you are editing both PANDAS and PANS, and yet your definition of the hypothetical PANS above does not seem to match the cited source, which discusses abrupt onset of OCD.  Furthermore, PANS is proposed for research purposes until there is more coverage, it doesn&#39;t belong in this (an unrelated) article.   (Talk)

&#34;
 My opinions about PRT reflect the position of mainstream transit advocates in Minnesota such as the Sierra Club North Star Chapter . It is reasonable and moderate to rely on facts instead of conjecture. PRT does not exist in revenue service anywhere in the world. Any claims about PRT are merely conjecture, not fact.  Any comparisons between PRT and other proven modes of transport is meaningless, unless the purpose  is to mislead. What I have successfully proven in print and on the internet is that many PRT advocates use &#34;&#34;facts&#34;&#34; based on conjecture that PRT can out-perform conventional, existing modes of transport to argue that public funding for transit is wasteful. You can see that for yourself in this video made by a PRT advocate.. One PRT &#34;&#34;fact&#34;&#34; often repeated by advocates in public meetings is that PRT can pay for itself out of fair-box revenue - you can hear that in this video and this video. Perhaps you can find a peer-reviewed article that gives an explanation how PRT can &#34;&#34;pay for itself&#34;&#34;. I have been unable to find any authoritative explanation how PRT can operate without public subsidies. Thank you.   &#34;

Re: Leilapk/anon IP. The sources you linked did refer to an Iranian wine called Shiraz but doesn&#39;t specify it as being from the Syrah Grape and in fact the Hugh Johnson Vintage: Story of Wine ref does describe as the same Shirazi wine which numerous reliable sources describe as being made in Shiraz. (And if you notice, the same Story of Wine ref you added is actually already being used in the Shirazi wine article. Additionally there are numerous reliable sources in this article, including links to the DNA evidence, that conclusively show that the Syrah wine grape originated in France. No one is denying that a Shirazi wine was made in the Iranian/Persian city of Shiraz and, indeed, we have an article dedicated to the subject and make reference to that article repeatedly in the Syrah article. But the abundance of evidence shows that the Shirazi wine (which was likely made from Trebbiano) and today modern Syrahs/Shirazes are different wines. Cheese/Wine

Carrero Blanco&#39;s death was applaud by the liberal and democratic forcesand it forced the transition to democracy, specifically to monarchy. That was a turning point in the history of Madrid and Spain; it also gives a social perspective in the history of how the relationship between people from Madrid and ETA changed with the transition to democracy itself.

Kosta was born in America, however, like most Greek Americans, he was raised by his parents, both from Greece, as a Greek, which is typical in the Greek American culture.  Because of this, Kosta now has Greek citizenship, which therefore classifies him as a Greek citizen who in fact was raised as one as well.

&#34;:Sorry for such late reply, while not on wikibreak exactly, I&#39;ve been busy enough in real life I haven&#39;t done any editing that takes time, as your question deserves.  I think the biggest issue with the article is that it makes no claim of notability.  Why does it stand out?  Why is it worth an encyclopedia article.  Please see WP:NOT and particularly WP:NOTDIR.  Although the article isn&#39;t the worst offender on promotion by any means, it still looks to be promoting services.  Read the other reviewer&#39;s comments, they are very valuable.

You have to remember that this article and its related episode page are about a series which is popular with, shall we say, &#34;&#34;younger&#34;&#34; editors (see the section above), so as a result often ends up being altered without much attention being paid to sentence construction by a multitude of different editors. Over time, this leads to mistakes.

Incidentally, the final &#34;&#34;produced by Tiger Television for the ITV network by Thames Television&#34;&#34; does make sense if you know the context - it means that it was made by a production company called Tiger Television for the London weekday broadcaster Thames TV, who in turn syndicated it to the UK-wide Independent Television (Channel 3) network. &#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39; talk &#34;

 Scientists Discuss &#34;&#34;Evolution&#34;&#34; 

My attempts to demonstrate evolution by an experiment carried on for more than 40 years have completely failed. It is not even possible to make a caricature of an evolution out of paleobiological facts. The idea of an evolution rests on pure belief. (Nils Heribert Nilsson, noted Swedish botanist and geneticist, of Lund University and evolutionist).

I think in fifty years, Darwinian evolution will be gone from the science curriculum. I think people will look back on it and ask how anyone could, in their right mind, have believed this, because it&#39;s so implausible when you look at the evidence. (Johnathan Wells, &#39;Icons of Evolution&#39;).

I have come to the conclusion that Darwinism is not a testable scientific theory, but a metaphysical research program. (Karl Popper, German born philosopher of science, called by Nobel Prize winner Peter Medawar, &#39;Incomparably the greatest philosopher of science who has ever lived&#39;).

Scientists who go about teaching that evolution is a fact of life are great con-men, and the story they are telling may be the greatest hoax ever! In explaining evolution we do not have one iota of fact. (Newton Tahmisian, Atomic Energy Commission).

The pathetic thing about it is that many scientists are trying to prove the doctrine of evolution, which no science can do. (Robert A. Milikan, physicist by provision and a Nobel Prize winner, speech before the American Chemical Society).

The miracles required to make evolution feasible are far greater in number and far harder to believe than the miracle of creation. (Richard Bliss, former professor of biology and science education as Christian Heritage College, It Takes a Miracle for Evolution).

The only competing explanation for the order we all see in the biological world is the notion of special creation. (Colin Patterson, evolutionist and senior Paleontologist at the British Museum of Natural History, which houses more than 60.000.000 fossils).

Evolution is a fairy tale for grown ups. This theory has helped nothing in the progress of science. It is useless. (Prof. Louis Bounoure, Director of Research, National Center of Scientific Research).

All of us who study the origin of life find that the more we look into it, the more we feel it is too complex to have evolved anywhere. We all believe as an article of faith that life evolved from dead matter on this planet. It is just that lifes complexity is so great, it is hard for us to imagine that it did. (Dr. Harold Urey, Nobel Prize winner).

A growing number of respectable scientists are defecting from the evolutionist camp, moreover, for the most part these Experts have abandoned Darwinism, not on the basis of religious faith or biblical persuasions, but on strictly scientific grounds, and in some instances, regretfully. (Dr. Wolfgang Smith, physicist and mathematician).

The evolution theory is purely the product of the imagination. (Dr. Ambrose Flemming, Pres. Philosophical Society of United Kingdom).

I have always been slightly suspicious of the theory of evolution because of its ability to account for any property of living beings. I have therefore tried to see whether biological discoveries over the last thirty years or so fit in with Darwins theory. I do not think that they do. To my mind, the theory does not stand up at all. (H. Lipson, A Physicist Looks at Evolution, Physic Bulletin, Page 138).

The talk of evolution is sheer nonsense not founded on observation and wholly unsupported by fact. This Museum is full of proof of the utter falsity of their view. (Niles Ethredge, British Museum of Science).

(Evolution is) a great cosmologic myth of the twentieth century. (Michael Denton, molecular biochemist, Evolution, Theory in Crisis).

The evolutionary establishment fears creation science, because evolution itself crumbles when challenged by evidence. In the 1970s and 1980s, hundreds of public debates were arranged between evolutionary scientists and creation scientists. The latter scored resounding victories, with the result that, today, few evolutionists will debate. Isaac Asimov, Stephen Jay Gould, and the late Carl Sagan, while highly critical of creationism, all declined to debate. (James Perloff, Tornado in a Junkyard, This book was published in the year 1999, Page 241).

Evolution is faith, a religion. (Louis T. More, professor of paleontology at Princeton University).

Evolution is baseless and quite incredible. (John Ambrose, The Unleashing of Evolutionary Thought).

Darwinism itself has become a religion. (Norman Macbeth).

There is no evidence, scientific or otherwise, to support the theory of evolution. (Cecil Wakely).

&#34;power versus energy
Good article, very well cited.  [User:Dick Mills]

While very many people confuse the terminology for power and energy, it is particularly embarrassing to do it in an article with such a title.   The Watt is a unit of power, the rate of consumption. Power can not be consumed.  Energy, which can be consumed, is measured in watt-hours or joules. 

The openening sentences which say, &#34;&#34;In 2004, the worldwide energy consumption of the human race was estimated at 15 TW with 86.3% from burning fossil fuels.[1] This is equivalent to 0.5 ZJ (= 1021 J) per year.&#34;&#34; should be changed to &#34;&#34;In 2004, the worldwide energy consumption of the human race was estimated at 0.5 ZJ (=1021 J) with 86.3% from burning fossil fuels.[1]  The average rate of consumption is thus 15 TW.&#34;&#34;   

Similarly, the labels on the the graphs should be changed. 

Unfortunately, the association of consumption with power (watts) continues throughout the article.  Again, &#34;&#34;The energy used to generate 2 TW of electricity is approximately 5 TW, as the efficiency of a typical existing power plant is around 38%.&#34;&#34; is incorrect.  One needs 5 TW of power (not energy) to create 2 TW of power at 38% efficiency. 

Even more unfortunate, I worry that some of the numbers are wrong because of the confusion between power and energy.  For things like wind, where a 100 MW generator operates at only 11% capacity factor, the difference between installed capacity and average production over a long period of time is 9:1.  A dominating factor.  I checked a couple of the references cited, and they too use power and energy inconsistently.  

It will take a major rewrite to correct this article.  Both the nomenclature and the numbers need to be checked.

Thanks for your comments. I can understand how debates with people who have a fundamentalist disposition can be very frustrating and in some ways provoke a similar response. I assure I have no axe to grind on this subject. There may be ideas put forward through certain forms of creationism that I simply do not believe because it contradicts the available scientific evidence and I may find certain claims put forward as science exaggerated. It would not stop me reporting those beliefs if they represented a significant number of people or if they had a significant impact in a given society even though they were only held by a minority, albeit influential, section of the community. For example if a country has only small minority of people who believe in a literal six days account of creation yet they have an disproportionate influence on that society, for example in education, politics or the media, then I would cite the best available work(s) I know that support their idea but I would also put in the best arguments against them in a concise summary of the issue with links wherever possible to other articles that examine particular issues in more depth. I approach these kind of articles by imagining that I am an open minded reader who knows little about the subject but would like to see what the main issues are without anybody censoring or filtering out material they personally do not believe in. This imaginary reader likes to form his own opinions based on the best available information with a preference for top down structure in the article, i.e. general outlines of the issue followed by a more detailed exposition. I hope this helps you understand my outlook.  Finally I am sorry for offending you, it certainly was not intended, and if our paths ever cross on the sea be sure to say hello!

 European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) Decision On The 1915 Armenian Event 
This must be added to the article:
On 17 December 2013, (the case: Perinçek v. Switzerland (application no. 27510/08)) European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) punished Switzerland for criminally convicting Mr. Perinçek for publicly challenging the existence of the Armenian genocide. Perinçek said &#34;&#34;Armenian genocide is an international lie&#34;&#34;. ECHR punished Switzerland for violating Perinçek&#39;s right of freedom of expression (Article 10). ECHR referenced three decisions on its verdict: 
a. In November 2007, The Spanish Constitutional Court had found unconstitutional the offence of negation and had taken the view that
the mere negation of a crime of genocide did not constitute direct incitement to violence. 
b. In February 2012, the French Constitutional Council had declared unconstitutional a law which made it a criminal offence to deny the existence of the genocides recognised by the law, finding it to be incompatible with freedom of expression and freedom of research. 
c. The United Nations Human Rights Committee had expressed its conviction that [l]aws that penalize[d] the expression of opinions about historical facts [were] incompatible with the obligations that the Covenant [on Civil and Political Rights] impose[d] on States parties ... and that the Covenant [did] not permit general prohibition of expressions of an erroneous opinion or an incorrect interpretation of past events.ECHR ECHR punished Switzerland for criminally convicting Mr. Perinçek for publicly challenging the existence of the Armenian genocide (Perinçek said &#34;&#34;Armenian genocide is an international lie&#34;&#34;).

I hope now that the researchers can freely and without any fear research what happened in 1915.
Notice that in 2013 ALL Ottoman Empire archieves are open to the researchers and any researcher can freely read ALL the archieves and documents in Turkey.
However, Armenia still does not allow its archieves to be searched and reserached. 212.174.38.3

&#34;==Author&#39;s comments==

I posted the following comments on the userpage, but moved them now to this talk page with minor edits:

The following changes are suggested:

 Mark &#34;&#34;Requests for Adminship&#34;&#34; as historical, and open the new process, &#34;&#34;Sysop Applications.&#34;&#34;
 Replace the standard three RFA questions with the six questions shown below.  
 Question 3 - how the applicant intends to use the sysop tools - is similar to old question 1. 
 Question 4, asking for the applicant&#39;s article writing experience, is based on old Question 2. 
 I have removed old question 3 about conflicts with other users.
 Questions 1 and 2 are added to establish minimum criteria.  Only one user (Lustiger.seth) who failed these criteria has become a sysop in the last several years.  Having these criteria on the application should eliminate the need for WP:NOTNOW closes to premature RFAs.
 Questions 5 and 6 are added to establish the candidate&#39;s character for honesty.  Why this wasn&#39;t done years ago after the Archtransit scandal is hard for me to understand.  Disclosure of material negative information should be expected of all applicants.
 Remove the old system of voting &#34;&#34;support&#34;&#34;, &#34;&#34;oppose&#34;&#34;, or &#34;&#34;neutral&#34;&#34; with a reason in your vote.  Instead, vote &#34;&#34;support&#34;&#34; or &#34;&#34;oppose&#34;&#34; without giving a reason.  Then, if you choose to give a reason, you may comment in the &#34;&#34;Concerns&#34;&#34; section or on the talk page of the Application.
 This change will reduce the &#34;&#34;pile-on&#34;&#34; effect of oppose voting.  Normally, in old RFAs, support voters vote without saying much, whereas oppose voters write long comments.  The oppose votes are disorganized insofar as oppose vote number 13 may refer back to oppose votes number 2 and 6.  The cumulative effect of oppose votes with long reasons is to say &#34;&#34;we hate you.&#34;&#34;  
 The new model removes this asymmetry.  You can still oppose, but you can&#39;t say more in your oppose vote than a supporter would say in her support vote.  The cumulative effect of bare support and oppose votes is &#34;&#34;some of us like you, and some don&#39;t.&#34;&#34;  To the extent that reasons for opposing the candidate need to be explained, the voter can explain in the &#34;&#34;Concerns&#34;&#34; section.
 No &#34;&#34;neutral&#34;&#34; votes.  If you don&#39;t want to vote, nobody is forcing you.  Neutral votes are pointless.
 We can decide later what a passing score should be.  For now we can allow bureaucrats to use their discretion as they currently do.

The following features will be maintained from the old RFA process:
 Bureaucrats decide the outcome after a 7-day discussion.
 A nominator may praise the candidate.  That is probably the one positive aspect of old RFA that is worth preserving.

CJ DUB Keeps Calling Users Ignorant - Violation of Wiki Rules
Hi, Deb. The user, CJ DUB continues to break Wiki rules by disrespecting others by insulting me. He stated the following, yet again: You are in fact ignorant. He also claims to be an editor &#34;&#34;with experience&#34;&#34;. A serious wiki editor with experience does not speak so ignorantly and disrespectfully about others. A wiki editor examines facts without judging others, as is the case in discriminatory environments. Therefore, he is not a wiki editor and is most likely a poser. He seems to be a sensitive american &#34;&#34;man&#34;&#34; who feels everyone is against him or his american way of thinking. He must understand that not everyone will like him or his background. I have also noticed that another user named, Seb, may be the same person. He&#39;s probably using dual usernames in wiki. 
As a result of the above valid points, I urge blocking him for a long while so he learns to respect others on this forum. Again, he&#39;s broken wiki rules on respect for others 3 times. Thank you.

this isnt a court of law.. its not like someone signed a search warrant wrong and now all the information is inadmissable

and talking about getting your lawyer is just obnoxious, marina... you are a celebrity in the public eye and thus fair game to be discussed.

Gary, the 4-cylinder specas are just there for filler. I know there are several types of engines, but I don&#39;t know if we&#39;ll ever have enough info for more than one article. The 6-cylinder model in the specs appears to be about the only one that had any significant prodution, so we may not find specs for the others, but if we do, good. They did all use the same cylinders, as far as I can tell from what I&#39;ve found. There really isn&#39;t much on the series available, so if we only have one decent article, that is more that most sources have! Thansk for your help, it is much appreciated. I do have some info from Gunston and a few other sources that describe the gearing and other features of the engines, but I don&#39;t understand most of it. I&#39;ll try to copy it here this week or neext, adn see if your or some of the others can &#34;&#34;interpret&#34;&#34; it! -   &#34;

Advertising

There&#39;s a line for Total Comfort Insulation that appears to be more of an advertisement than a reference to another article.  I had removed it previously, along with some realphebetizine, but the person who put it there originally reverted the whole change.  I realphabetized the list but kept the line in, although it really does not belong unless there&#39;s an article entitled &#34;&#34;Total Comfort Insulation&#34;&#34; here in Wikipedia that it can refer to  without such an article, and just a reference to someone&#39;s name, it looks like advertising, which I believe is prohibited.  I&#39;m not going to start a revert war  someone else can delete it if appropriate.&#34;

I know no such thing.  It&#39;s possible that your computer was displaying a cached version of the page, in which case you would have seen a prior version.  However, the edit history shows the sequence of events clearly.  The fact is that you jumped to the assumption that I was operating in bad faith, which is something that your history shows you do all too often.

What I was asking you to redact was not the &#34;&#34;if that can be sourced properly&#34;&#34; bit — that was a simple error.  What I objected to was your statement, &#34;&#34;I see you are now joining in the Bad Faith discussion that Richard Arthur Norton is perpetrating, in which you reply to or redact commentaries in a way that deliberately makes mine look as though I am ignoring what you say. Deplorable behavior.&#34;&#34;  I have done no such thing, and the evidence shows it.  Please strike through that passage. — (talk • contribs) &#34;

&#34;At culturally conservative BYU... ==

Not sure how failing to protest against the war or the Mormon church policies is relevant. Even though it has been argued that it is relevant &#34;&#34;since some Mormons did.&#34;&#34;  Not sure about Romney specifically but some people find it more advantages to work within the system instead of protesting the system.  It is also like saying we should include he is for the belief that the moon landing was staged because he has not spoken out against those who believe it was staged.  Recommend removing this sentence.

Interesting  I know this started off as a joke, but it would be quite possible for us actually implement some sort of tracking system, if there was an authoritative web service available for a given article subject. For example, if the paddle steamer registered with Google Latitude, it would not at all be beyond the wit of man to create a template {{coord url}} that would use the access of that URL, either Mediawiki server-side or JS client-side, to fill in the coordinates on the page.

&#34;:::Nice to hear you&#39;re keeping an open mind. Why should I concede a point if I disagree. I don&#39;t debate if I agree, there&#39;s no need to. Here&#39;s how it works: I make a point. You disagree and make a counter-point.  If I am swayed by your point, I concede that your argument was stronger than mine and we move on. The reason I don&#39;t concede is that I disagree with your points.  We might agree on some level; however the point you hoped that I&#39;d concede was central to my counter-argument. It follows that since there is little unique information in the individual articles, they should not be listed separately. If I agree with you that there is significant information in the individual articles, then it weakens my whole argument.  Maybe it&#39;s my debate background that&#39;s getting the best of me.  I&#39;m engaging you in a debate and rather than disagreeing with me and responding, you&#39;re saying that I&#39;m being hostile. If you consider disagreement with you &#34;&#34;hostility,&#34;&#34; I don&#39;t know where to go from there. If your intent is to sway me, you&#39;re not going to have very much luck. I&#39;ve laid my case out and it&#39;s rock solid. Feel free to counter me now.  That&#39;s how it&#39;s done.

&#34; is hard to read, unreferenced, and confusing for most people who are not familiar with the subject matter. The concept is not well explained, and the article provides little context about what this so-called &#34;&#34;theory&#34;&#34; actually is.

I removed the suspect paragraph:
A little known early fact about Pasadena is the presence of a ship&#39;s mascot in the form of a North American snapping turtle.  The animal was kept by the crew during construction at Electric Boat, and was even aboard during her launching into the Thames River.  Immediately prior to commissioning, the turtle, named Frumpy, was donated to California Polytechnic University in Pasadena, CA.
Pasadena was launched into the Thames because she was built at Electric Boat on the Thames. That makes sense. &#34;&#34;California Polytechnic University in Pasadena,&#34;&#34; on the other hand, makes no sense.  &#34;

Hypocrisy on Wikipedia?
Lately I&#39;ve been busy on the Jesse Jackson article on Wikipedia trying to put in a ridiculous quote of his into the article, yet I&#39;ve been repeatedly told that that violates NPOV, even though the quote is cited. Yet from reading this article on Savage, I see that the liberals have had a field day in printing negative stuff about Savage.

If it&#39;s cited, there&#39;s nothing that you can do about it.&#34;&#34; I think that all of you guys who put negative stuff into this article should be helping me get that particular quote into the Jesse Jackson article, or can only negative stuff about conservatives be written on Wikipedia? &#34;

Although Ken Barnes is a fucking moron, we need more criticism to balance it out
Hi, As one of the primary authors of this page, I want to make it absolutely clear that I in no way agree with the ridiculous statements made in the citation I added from &#34;&#34;rock critic&#34;&#34; Ken Barnes. Having contributed nothing to music himself, it is outrageous that he would have the nerve to attack what is arguably the greatest Queen album. Nonetheless, we need criticism as well in order to better balance the article out. I have also added many wonderful things lately, such as Freddie&#39;s top listings in international polls, so don&#39;t worry too much. I also want to make it clear that, although I cite &#34;&#34;Rolling Stone&#34;&#34; a lot, I basically consider it to be a magazine for people who are musically illiterate. Forgive me, Freddie!

In a recent edit, SlimVirgin indicated that the article was &#34;&#34;already too long&#34;&#34;, and that some information was &#34;&#34;already mentioned elswhere&#34;&#34;.

You&#39;re right, Pax. He was from the 9th century, not the 10th. If he existed in the 10th century, he&#39;d have probably seen Knez Vladimir Dukljanski (Jovan Vladimir). Besides, I found out that on the Geneaology of the rulers of Montenegro at montenegrina.net, Archont Petar is listed to have ruled during the 9th century, opening up a possibility that Archont Petar is indeed Petar Gojniković.

A tag has been placed on your article Anna glypta, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article seems to be a biographical account about a person, group of people, or band, but it does not indicate how or why he/she/they is/are notable.  If you can indicate why Anna glypta is really notable, I advise you to edit the article promptly, and also put a note on Talk:Anna glypta. Any admin should check for such edits before deleting the article. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.

Dear sir 

please read NPOV, WP:MOS, WP:RS, and stop being an idiot.

The section I am trying to repair CLEARLY violates NPOV. It even has a warning up top which is why I was trying to repair it in the first place. Several sections appear either lifted straight from other propaganda essays (e.g. COPYRIGHT VIOLATIONS!!!!) or fail to properly attribute quotes, or are violations of WP:SYNTH.

&#34;
 For the record, here is the edit in question. Although the statement made by Onorem is uncivil, it is hard to disagree with it, and it certainly is not a personal attack. The very policy  cited suggests that him deleting that post was &#34;&#34;controversial&#34;&#34; at best, and the fact that he, , did it without any consensus that it constituted a &#34;&#34;personal attack&#34;&#34;, twice, ot to mention his absurd accusation that I had made a personal attack just by restoring that comment, leaves much to be desired. ~   &#34;

The source  also does not use the word develope. The source does say: &#34;&#34;The evidence for the Big Bang comes from many pieces of observational data that are consistent with the Big Bang.&#34;&#34; and &#34;&#34;... many observations support the Big Bang ...&#34;&#34; (over alternatives). I dont quite see how, you manage to summarize that to: &#34;&#34;evidence has led to further development of the model&#34;&#34;. I have replace the sentence with something that actually matches the source (using the word &#34;&#34;support&#34;&#34;).R &#34;

&#39;Nuff said. Or perhaps not. Here&#39;s a tidbit from that last WS &#34;&#34;Trivia&#34;&#34; section linked above:

 According to Tug McGraw, one of the police horses, who lined up in the field during the 9th inning of Game 6, was not &#34;&#34;stadium trained.&#34;&#34; (8th item down the list)

I don&#39;t think you can top (or is it bottom?) that for trivia. There&#39;s a simple reason that over a quarter of a century of trivia sections (and probably more) have piled up in these World Series articles: Writing well is hard work. It&#39;s just too easy to simply drop minutiae onto these pages and file them under &#34;&#34;Trivia&#34;&#34; and let somebody else do the hard work of integrating them . . . later. 

Part of my motivation for dredging up all those links above is that I&#39;ve noticed an inconsistency of style and layout, and some confusing or redundant info in all the WS articles going back to 1903. It&#39;s like the same car built by different contractors at different times with different materials. I find it a bit troubling because it&#39;s a sign of limited effort, limited means for anybody to have developed a plan for what could be a real highlight of WP (can you say &#34;&#34;Fall Classic Portal&#34;&#34;?). I found it fairly easy to take the &#39;06 trivia about La Russa and Leyland and create a separate section under the &#34;&#34;Background&#34;&#34; section, and it seems to have held up since Friday night. But it took some time to sift through it and move the info.

Cutting to the chase: All this WS &#34;&#34;Trivia&#34;&#34; is classifiable. The better it&#39;s organized, the less it will seem like trivia, so if a handful of &#34;&#34;labels&#34;&#34; could be cooked up for categories of info formerly known as trivia, the overall style of these articles will seem to read better. That ought to settle the trivia issue.

Postscript: For instance, a 4-1 WS where one contender splits &#34;&#34;on the road&#34;&#34; and then comes home and sweeps to win 3 more and clinch is fairly rare from what I&#39;ve looked up so far. What the Cards have done against Detroit in 2006 matches what NY (NL) accomplished in 1969 (except the Mets dropped Game 1 instead of 2 to Baltimore). I&#39;m still working my way thru past Fall Classics to see when else this happened, so I can add this info to the &#39;06 article in an appropriate place, but not as an addition to the dreaded Trivia section. A heading that might be appropriate for this info each and every year: Long series, short series. 4 or 5 games would classified as a short series, 6 or 7 classified as long. Easy to spot trends in this area and develop copy to fill a section like this. Was a short or long series predicted each year; by who; was a trend broken, were the prognosticators wrong, did a noted BB writer point this out so it doesn&#39;t smack of the dreaded Original Research? Now really &#39;nuff said.   (talk)  &#34;

Jungle Fight 
About your comments:
01. They had 11 events in 2011 and 10 in 2012. Why would you revise that number upwards? Ten seems to be a good number for a serious organization. JF is the largest organization in Brazil.
02. Jungle Fight had exactly five title fights in 2012. Two in JF 47, two in JF 37, one in JC 36.
03. Their events are shown on ESPN outside Brazil since JF 20. In Brazil, their events started to be shown before that.
04. About their number of fighters, it&#39;s better if you keep the rules simple. For example, require that at least 50 fighters fought in the organization in the span of a year. What do you think about that?

I know it seems weird for Jungle Fight to have the same or more points than Strikeforce, but we have other options instead of gaming the system against Jungle Fight. The current way to determine what is a top or second tier organization puts full weight on the rankings, while your system gives minimal weight to it. I think we should find a middle ground, while at the same time keep things as simple as possible. In order to do so, I would scrap criteria 3 and 8, and use a criteria based on rankings determined by Fight Matrix. That criteria could amount to 1/3 or 1/2 of all possible points. The advantages would be that the main organizations would certainly be ahead of other, while at the same time event short lived but notable organizations would have a high score. By using Fight Matrix, we would be able to easily determine how many points defunct organizations would have. Maybe we could present such a system as a possible substitute to the current way we use to determine notability?

True, the edit in question fails both categories. It just so happens that i know (but can&#39;t source) that the current version (&#39;and he was staring at the sky&#39;) is false. The reporting officer felt that alluding to a guy dancing naked in the street and singing Rick Astley&#39;s greatest hit after committing such a crime would read like a stupid joke or even a provocation (the Rickrolling craze had already started by then). Alas, it is what in fact happened. But the real question is: Where the hell is the vandalism on my part after all?

 Idea for Talmud articles 

Hi Avraham: I am reposting the following request from User  on my user talk page for wider notification:

I was thinking of trying to stimulate development of a series of articles on Gemara concepts and doctrines, maybe to help children or newcomers to Gemara with explanations of some fundamental concepts that recur throughout the Gemara. Some examples might be articles on Yiush, Chazakah, Ta&#39;aninun (as in &#34;&#34;Ta&#39;aninun L&#39;Yoresh&#34;&#34;), Eidim Zomemin (forgive my awful transliterations), Migu, etc., etc. Maybe we could even create a category or subcategory for it. I created Breira in this vein. As I don&#39;t have the experience or expertise in Wikipedia to know what to do to best develop this idea, I figured I&#39;d come to you for your opinions on: (1) whether it&#39;s a good idea; and (2) How to best go about implementing it. Thanks   

Centralized discussion at: Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Judaism#Idea for Talmud articles. Thank you.   &#34;

It&#39;s amazing how people who don&#39;t watch the games at all try to remain NPOV. Oden threw him on the floor. It&#39;s a god damned fact. Oden even admitted after the game it was a frustration foul, and he was intentionally throwing a hard foul. If the refs aren&#39;t concerned with star power and name brand teams, Xavier wins the game, plain and simple.
You&#39;re a high school football ref? Stick to football. I hope you don&#39;t try and protect star players too.

&#34;    \Thanx

But:   
I am NOT intersted to sign, as I do DISAGREE  with many who are granted the privilege of monitoring the Wikipedia  as moderators.
  
We  first need to clean the house  and get those who should NOT be moderators as they luck the qualifications.

This  applies to some moderators from EASTERN EUROPE  with unintentional nationalistic or  pro-communist orientation, some military personell as moderators is vandalizing articles with wrong methods of confrontation,  and some members of US  Congress who are correcting their CV (RESUMES)  specially  prior to e(R)ections.

This applies also to people  specialy those with PhDs  who think they know it all and in real life they only read some required by programs books prepared by special intersts and really know nothing!
  
To many  young, inexperienced while colorful &#34;&#34;PHEASANTS&#34;&#34; are  allowed to be moderators.

The YOUTH  and  inexperienced irrational behavior is NOT a substitude for over half of the century education and experience.

Sorry we&#39;ll never meet Doc. There&#39;s been success, and failure. The success is that there is discusion on the talk page for the Dawn Wells bio, and it&#39;s focused. I see people stepping forward to say the things that need be said and to press for answers to fair questions to those with opposing viewpoints. The failure? Perhaps none. A sacrifice had to be made.

My future plans 

I have some news for my friends (and enemies?).  I am leaving Wikipedia (this time for real) at the end of June 2009.  I have gotten tired of the daily grind, and of the other combative editors.  I will use the remaining time to catch up on projects that I wish to complete at Wikipedia.  Now you can all get out the crying towels!!

 Chick Flick 
I disagree with the definition of &#34;&#34;Chick Flick&#34;&#34; and have issue with it, partly of personal definition and somewhat justifiably as it is uncited. &#34;&#34;Chick Flick&#34;&#34; is not simply about the popularity with women but with women as a target audience and not necessary a &#34;&#34;romance&#34;&#34; or have romance as a main theme (learned in school, looking for reference). Just think of the more recent &#34;&#34;chick flicks&#34;&#34; like Boys on the Side (arguably about failing romance but the uniting theme is their friendship), Thelma and Louise (again, female &#34;&#34;partners in crime&#34;&#34;), Riding in Cars With Boys (despite the title, the larger theme is her relationship with her father and her son, not just her boyfriend/husband), and The Women (female friendships where only one friend is truly affected by her -lack of- romantic relationship with her husband). 

I&#39;m not ready to remove it yet as currently &#34;&#34;chick flick&#34;&#34; redirects to a Charmed episode and it deserves a mention somewhere else. I&#39;d be so happy if someone beats me to the punch as it may take a while to find references now that I no longer have access to online journals. However, it shouldn&#39;t stay as it is.  &#34;

 White Chile 

I don&#39;t know who is the user who keeps including Chile as a &#34;&#34;white&#34;&#34; country. It&#39;s incredible that somebody erases Chile, then a few days the name of the country is back again. There are no sources that claim Chile is predominantly &#34;&#34;white&#34;&#34;. The census there count mestizos and whites together. It makes no sense. Others claim 30% is white, which is not majority either.   &#34;

I have posted nothing on the article page as this would presumably be a Conflict of Interest, and have made here suggestions of the way in which the book may be used only because requested - my view remains that it should be done by an editor who does not have COI. I think that now we&#39;ve moved on from the efforts to exclude a source through (wrong) application of the Notability guidelines we&#39;re left with Neutrality of Point of View as the main issue. Wikipedia reports what is out there and a decision to exclude entirely from an article an appropriate source which has a view on much that is in the article (as well as topics the article excludes) appears to be a bias. The idea that the only book of lit crit on Beedle the Bard has nothing whatsoever to add to an encyclopaedia article on the topic is incredible. I don&#39;t think COIN is central to the issue as it now stands; rather the central issue is NPV. I think there are wider issues which it would be interesting to discuss - for example had my username not been essentially my real name a post on the talk page a year ago saying &#34;&#34;hi guys, this book exists and has something to say about the article&#34;&#34; would not have generated this negative discussion. I suggest MedCab is a way forward because it can consider all issues, while COIN considers only one issue and probably one which is not central.   &#34;

Hi again; here&#39;s a question for you. In Story, at the start of the fifth paragraph I find, &#34;&#34;Surprising Zeus and seizing the Blade of Olympus, the pair battle with Kratos incapacitating Zeus.&#34;&#34; Who are the pair? I want to clarify this sentence but I cannot find a reference to another character teaming up with Zeus to battle Kratos - although it&#39;s possible I missed it. Thanks,   &#34;

&#34;Can we also colour code the tables for versions to match the historical distribution chart in the same way that both the Windows Phone and iOS version history articles do? This would add a much needed splash of colour and defeat some of the repetitiveness from the article. Thanks 20 (email)

@ so you have no sources that state that &#34;&#34;muslims do not consider him to be the founder of their faith&#34;&#34;. Your inference from the sources you quoted is WP:OR and in the presence of WP:RS supporting the fact that many muslims call him founder, such OR amounts to nothing. Perhaps you can try to find actual sources, otherwise, this isn&#39;t looking good for your case.   &#34;

A back-up 

Mr. Truesilver Cabal, don&#39;t know what I&#39;d do without your assistance and helpful meddling. You folks are really amusing. And by the way, I don&#39;t do personal attacks.

You thrice deleted an article I was beginning to build about a published author, stating that I could add various info, such as biographical detail.  It may some day occur to you that this is what I was in the process of doing, except that your vandalism destroyed the article within a few moments of creation.  I am new to Wikipedia, so perhaps there is a complaint mechanism for constraining your behavior that does not involve me deleting you, or your creations.

 Examples of errors in this version 

These are examples, not a comprehensive list. While typing it I had the very off-putting feeling that I had already done this several times, evidenced here. It hasn&#39;t worked with you, you&#39;re still unreasaonble, but I do it anyway for emphasis, and for the benefit of others. 

 &#34;&#34;The term &#34;&#34;Arabic numerals&#34;&#34; is actually a misnomer&#34;&#34;
 This smacks of political revisionism of the worst kind; what is known in English as the Arabic Numerals are the Arabic Western Numerals, not even the Arabic Eastern Numerals. Yes, they are derived from ancient Indian numerals but nonetheless they are the Arabic Numerals. Look here, the norm is that when people in English say Arabic Numerals they are referring to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, those are the Arabic (Western) Numerals, they are not referring to १, २, ३, ४, ५, ६, ७, ८, ९, and other varities of Indian numerals, modern or ancient. They are known in English as the Arabic Numerals, that&#39;s a fact, I will not accept a revisionist statement that counters a fact so early on in the text the article, the article must start with the factual. I&#39;ll accept it under a revisionism section much later on, but it must be balanced there with opinions counter to it (counter to the counterfactual). 

 &#34;&#34;... what are known in English as &#34;&#34;Arabic numerals&#34;&#34; were neither invented nor widely used by the Arabs.&#34;&#34;, &#34;&#34;In the Arab World—until modern times—the Arabic numeral system was used only by mathematicians. Muslim scientists used the Babylonian numeral system, and merchants used a numeral system similar to the Greek numeral system and the Hebrew numeral system. Therefore, it was not until Fibonacci that the Arabic numeral system was used by a large population.&#34;&#34;
 What reliable sources do you have that they were not widely used by the Arabs? Why don&#39;t you cite reliable sources? Here&#39;s evidence that they were  The numerals though were already in wide use throughout the Arab empire, as Avicenna who was born in 980 tells in his autobiography that he learnt them, as a child, from a humble vegetable seller. He also tells that when his father, in Bukhara, was visited by scholars from Egypt in 997, including Abu Abdullah al-Natili, they taught him more about them. J J O&#39;Connor and E F Robertson point out: He also tells of being taught Indian calculation and algebra by a seller of vegetables. All this shows that by the beginning of the eleventh century calculation with the Indian symbols was fairly widespread and, quite significantly, was known to a vegetable trader.

 &#34;&#34;The first inscriptions using 0 in India have been traced to approximately 200 CE.&#34;&#34;
 Why don&#39;t you cite reliable sources?! Here, I&#39;ll cite some: According to Professor EF Robertson and DR JJ O&#39;Connor, &#34;&#34;The first record of the Indian use of zero which is dated and agreed by all to be genuine was written in 876&#34;&#34; on the Gwalior tablet stone. This is also verified by Professor Lam Lay Yong, an an Effective Member of the International Academy of the History of Science &#34;&#34;the earliest appearance in India of a symbol for zero in the Hindu-Arabic numeral system is found in an inscription at Gwalior which is dated 870 AD&#34;&#34;. According to Menninger (p. 400): &#34;&#34;This long journey begins with the Indian inscription which contains the earliest true zero known thus far (Fig. 226). This famous text, inscribed on the wall of a small temple in the vicinity of Gvalior (near Lashkar in Central India) first gives the date 933 (A.D. 870 in our reckoning) in words and in Brahmi numerals. Then it goes on to list four gifts to a temple, including a tract of land &#34;&#34;270 royal hastas long and 187 wide, for a flower-garden.&#34;&#34; Here, in the number 270 the zero first appears as a small circle (fourth line in the Figure); in the twentieth line of the inscription it appears once more in the expression &#34;&#34;50 wreaths of flowers&#34;&#34; which the gardeners promise to give in perpetuity to honor the divinity.&#34;&#34; The Encyclopaedia Britannica says, &#34;&#34;Hindu literature gives evidence that the zero may have been known before the birth of Christ, but no inscription has been found with such a symbol before the 9th century.&#34;&#34; I&#39;ll accept mention prior to the Gwalior tablet, in fact, the article needs it and I&#39;m planning on doing it once I&#39;m no longer distracted by your nonsense, but such mention must be well-phrased so as not to mislead and contradict scientific consensus, and the phrasing must be limited to the exact intent of verifiable and reliable sources.

Good job for having your bully NeilN defend you.  You sure are a piece of work.  Goodbye Wikipedia, congratulations, you will never be accurate while you behave like this.  All I did was add accurate information.  Helen, hang your head in shame, in serious, severe shame.  I hope that you see the level of harm you have done, even if NeilN doesn&#39;t because his head is too far up his own backside to actually check any facts. 123.2.223.96

Martyrs

Where do you get off refering to Police Officers who die in the line of duty as &#34;&#34;Martyrs&#34;&#34;? Perhaps the next time you find yourself in a situation where you need a Police Officer you should call on an employee of a used bookstore or maybe a wannabee author-or better yet, someone who looks like a drug addicted throwback to the sixties. Now lets hear you cry about how youve been

Undid my &#34;&#34;personal attack&#34;&#34; at WP:COIN(??)
&gt;Rsradford, I undid your latest edit at the noticeboard. You realize that administators patrol that noticeboard, right? You and Jack can both be blocked if you continue in that tone. Rephrase whatever you wanted to say without commenting on the character of the editor. If needed I will remove the other guy&#39;s personal attacks as well. EdJohnston (talk) &gt;

I am honestly at a loss to understand this.  &#34;&#34;Jack&#39;s&#34;&#34; confederate and fellow Rydberg cultist CarlaO&#39;Harris attacked me on that forum in the most personal terms imaginable, to which I did not respond at all.  Instead, I set out three verifiable facts concerning the direct financial conflict of interest that underlies all of &#34;&#34;Jack&#39;s&#34;&#34; edits to the Rydberg article.  If that response is unacceptable, so be it  but would it be asking too much for you also to delete the completely unfounded personal attack on me by CarlaO&#39;Harris?   &#34;

 Really , it should be obvious to you from context that I was implying that you were an unpaid or underpaid intern rather than a millionaire working directly for the Clintons. Admit it or not it really is surprisingly popular for political campaigns to hire sub-par, unofficial wikipedians in residence to try and out edit wikipedians that encourage a neutral view of their candidate. I don&#39;t know that I agree with all of  edits but after  and company teaming up to attack a single plea for citation I find it much easier to believe the Professor&#39;s good faith.  ☎ &#34;

Only Breath 

Nor Christian or Jew or Muslim, not Hindu,Buddhist, Sufu, of Zen. Not any religion of cultural system. 
I am not from the East or the West, nor out of the ocean or up from the ground, not earth or air, 
not composed of elements at all. I do not exist, am not an entity in this world or the next,
did not descend from Adam or Eve or any origin story. 
My place is placeless, a trace of the traceless. Neither body nor soul.
I belong to the beloved, have seen the two worlds as one and that one [I] call to and know,
first, last, outer, inner, only that breath breathing human being.
 
As you know this is a Rumi poem. And this is the most real, most reliable, and most genuine source about him. He rejets religions and cultural systems here(islamic culture, persian culture and turkish culture). He says clearly did not descend from Adam or Eve or any origin story, therefore why are you doing Rumi persian? He clearly rejects these, all origin histories. Besides you emphasize his birthplace and lived regions. He says My place is placeless, a trace of the traceless. Under this circumstances, i&#39;m moving his disputed ethnic origin, his disputed nation. He rejects all of these. While he rejects why are you sticking these labels by force? He rejects. This is most reliable source about him, because he has written himself, not iranian scholars. I have put this poem to references.

Request de-adminship of  User:OwenX. User:Ledenierhomme‎ removed my vote from an AfD debate. 

This is vandalism, simple. I reported the matter to the administrator notice board for vandalism. Yet all OwenX did was to remove my complaint, doing nothing to Ledenierhomme. report elsewhere means nothing and does not help.

No reason was given for its removal or why the need to be placed elsewhere. This is extremely unprofessional and rude. Also why are other users allowed to remove my votes, perhaps OwenX would care to comment on that. Please remove OwenXs admin rights for being  unprofessional and unhelpful. Regards,

Just looked at the &#34;&#34;Maple Falls&#34;&#34; page some, no it&#39;s not the massive Genstar development but a certain &#34;&#34;back&#34;&#34; area between Silverdale and Silverhill that had been farmland....and doesn&#39;t have the view of the Cheam Range (Four Sisters) that it on its front page; it faces west, not east, and has only a glimpse of view of alpine on the Golden Ears glimpsed over Blue Mountain, if at all.  But then the realty marketing business is rarely about reality.  &#34;

Example:  Say there are 10 equally good horses in a race.  The odds would be decimal 10 or 9:1 to be fair.  But typically the odds available will be decimal 8 or 7:1 at best.  Backing 9 of the horses with a stake of GBP10 each in order to lay the remaining horse results in a loss of GBP20 no matter which horse wins.    05:10, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)

Thank you for your welcoming remarks on my talk page (talk). 1)I can (and do)prommote what you call &#34;&#34;mashichist&#34;&#34; views and still try to do it remaining NPOV as I have actualy done in last few months 2) NPOV is in the eye of the beholder as well as any other rule . See for example the Gil Student&#39;s page deletion proccess to view examples of extreme bias against him by some of the Chabad WikiPedians and their attempts to hide that bias by quoting the WikiPedia  rules. Or see the reverts of the Chabad page and the Rebbes page by various people and some of the things they posted on the corresponding talk pages to &#34;&#34;prove&#34;&#34; the &#34;&#34;anti-mashichist&#34;&#34; agenda or &#34;&#34;anti-mashichist&#34;&#34; &#34;&#34;domination&#34;&#34; of the &#34;&#34;official Chabad&#34;&#34;

&#34;Durrr..??? - OMS!! Do you really believe you needed to explain that to me?? (What ever gave you that idea??).Put that directly in the article if you like - AS I SAID. I thought we both had concurred that it was redundant Due to the (prepared via the Eschweiler-Clarke synthesis) linked reaction. I fail to see any point to this comment you have made to me. Or Again What were/are you &#34;&#34;trying&#34;&#34; to say. So as it appears all my previous words were lost on you, Shall we start again positively and constructively??.

I was blocked but then he changed his mind, but I would much rather talk about Russia with You D 

Wanna talk some Russia and Ukraine stuff?

If so I will get the ball rolling

Do you think Russia and Ukraine will unite again?
I think it is possible if Russias economy started grwoing even more then now and lots of ukranians moved there to get jobs.
After a few years of that some people might say hey why dont we unite again we all seem to be working in russia so why not become the same again?

What do you think, is it possible?

Relation to independence 

This concept of a set of generators seems to me to be like the Group theory analogue of an algebraically independent set and a Basis (linear algebra) basis, or linearly independent set. Has anyone else noted this similarity or seen it noted? Further discussion would be interesting.

Approximately 500 pages have been used for discussion without any conclusion. The learned editors perhaps avoided to consult the other encyclopedias on the subject matters.

Re: Change for the better
Dear ChildofMidnight, thank you for the message. I hope that an outcome of the discussion will be a change of policy for the better. I will check and see how things are going on, but I doubt that I will continue to make any more contributions. Wikipedia has been good to me and I have been told via e-mails that I have done good with my work and made a difference in some people&#39;s life&#39;s which is really satisfiing. You have been a good person and I hope that this year brings you a lot of blessings.

Indeed they are. As a political science instructor, teaching classes at both a State college and a Christian college, I am amazed at the amount of pseudoscience that passes itself off as &#34;&#34;truth&#34;&#34; in the social sciences  and I&#39;m talking about notable textbooks used in classrooms, not just obvious examples like Bowling for Columbine and Sicko.

 Agreed. Though - like TDII - I am now questioning whether this depiction of a fringe minority group with the profession even needs to be given such a weighty mention. Anyhow, there does seem to be a growing consensus to including attribution to Keating - or at least a healthy majority.   discuss &#34;

You undid my additions to the Mountain Gorilla which clearly contributed to the page, Wikipedia, and the human species in its entirety. You are an anarchist and a communist. Sincerely hope you stub your big toe on your left foot tomorrow when you get out of bed. I would hope meaner things, but my just and kind heart is capable of no greater levels of hate than I have just described. Due to your rude behavior (which was completely uncalled for by the way) I will no longer contribute my vast intellectual knowledge to Wikipedia, depriving the world of knowledge that it deserves to have, and it is all thanks to you. I am obviously a far better man that you, and will waste no more of my time dealing with your pitiful existence.

I simply meant that sterilizing those with Down Syndrome would do nothing to &#34;&#34;improve the race&#34;&#34; or lessen the incidence of the condition. I&#39;m unsure of the eugenicists&#39; actual position on the syndrome, but considering some of the minor conditions they used to classify people as &#34;&#34;unfit&#34;&#34; (some well within the &#34;&#34;normal&#34;&#34; variance of human genetics), it seemed likely that they would have considered Down sufferers as unfit, and therefore candidates for segregation or sterilization. It would have been unjustified and fruitless, that&#39;s my point.  &#34;

A few points:
1) All cabals are bad ideas. If you want something done, find a taskforce, or create a workforce.
2) We are dealing w/ admins. The MfD might be snowballed.
3) I&#39;d like to see proof that there is proof, or isn&#39;t. Perhaps scanning the users&#39; contribs for any edit summary mention of the cabal.
4) I&#39;m in so much Wikitrouble now that...
A) if I get in anymore, I might be blocked
B) I really couldn&#39;t care less if I did
5) I won&#39;t nom it, but I&#39;ll support deletion (as goes for all those other cabals out there).

You can weigh these, and make your decision of what to do. Choose wisely, and let the WikiForce be w/ you. Basketball110 &#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;/Tell me yours &#34;

This is a follow-up criticism of Gwen Gale&#39;s improper deletion of the Alex Jones criticism section. I have tried to have this discussed in a responsible way on her Talk page but she has outrageously deleted all the critiques I have posted there. In my view, Gwen Gale&#39;s actions and judgement are seriously called into question by her conduct apparent in this thread and subsequent attempts to discuss it. I will post the text of the complaint I made below. If you agree that she has acted improperly, please respond saying so. Two people of this opinion (one other) are required before a Request for Comment on her actions can be made.

This is a complaint relating to the conduct of Administrator Gwen Gale with specific reference to her summary deletion of the section labelled Criticism in the Alex Jones Talk Show Host page on 15 March 2009.

Her most substantive comments relating to the summary deletion were as follows  
single source cited says it&#39;s not clear what even happened
I&#39;ve removed it following WP:BLP and WP:WEIGHT, given the single cited source says it&#39;s not even clear what happened, it&#39;s nothing but a non-notable, second-hand anecdote about what may or may not have been a parking lot brawl. Gwen Gale (talk) 
The grounds (as you put it) are WP:BLP. Gwen Gale (talk)  

The complaint is based on five points 
1/ Gwen Gale failed to follow proper policy with regard to deleting biographical material on living persons, viz. discussing it beforehand. The section had existed for some time, had been discussed and commented on extensively, and had been edited by several persons. As far as I am aware, Gwen Gale had no prior involvement in the page or the section concerned. Certainly, I had never seen her name in any of the page history. Unless it constituted a grave breach of some other policy, which not even Gwen Gale has claimed, any possible deletion should have been discussed beforehand and not executed summarily. To quote the BLP policy  Biographical material about a living individual that is not compliant with this policy should be improved and rectified; if this is not possible, then it should be removed.
No complaint about the nature of the material was made beforehand; no opportunity for improvement or rectification was offered. 
2/ Having failed to discuss it properly beforehand, Gwen Gale also failed to discuss it properly afterwards. She made a few general remarks, using terms which, as will be discussed later, do not form part of any Wikipedia policy, viz. single sourced, anecdotal, and breezily referred those who wanted to discuss the matter with her to general Wikipedia policy documents, such as Biography of Living Persons or Verifiability. As will be shown in what follows the text did not violate either of these policy documents. Gwen Gale refused multiple specific requests to quote the exact passages of the Biography on Living Persons or Verifiability policies which she claimed had been violated. This refusal to properly discuss a summary deletion is against Wikipedia conduct guidelines and not acceptable behaviour in an Administator.
3/ Gwen Gales comments on the summary deletion reveal that she does not understand the core Wikipedia policy on reliable sources.
4/ Gwen Gales comments indicate that she does not understand the proper scope of Wikipedias policy on Verifiability.
5/ Gwen Gales comments reveal that she does not understand Wikipedias Biography on Living Persons policy. 
The only serious grounds on which deletion of the deleted text could be justified is Weight. This is not the ground on which Gwen Gale chose to defend it. She repeatedly cited BLP and V as the core defence of her actions, demonstrating that her judgement is massively flawed and that her administrative powers should be revoked. The core issue here is not the content. The core issue is Gwen Gales conduct and judgement. The Weight issue will, however, be discussed at the end.

Gwen Gales Misunderstanding of the Wikipedias Guidelines on Reliable Sourcing
It is clear that Gwen Gale does not understand Wikipedias policy on sourcing. In stating that the claims embodied in the deleted text were anecdotal, she is effectively second-guessing the judgement of the original reliable source, viz. The Austin Chronicle. She is implicitly expressing the view that the Austin Chronicles assembled journalists, editors, sub-editors and lawyers made an error in judgement in publishing the article in the first place. This is completely unacceptable and represents a FUNDAMENTAL ERROR IN JUDGEMENT. It is in no way appropriate for Wikipedia editors to make their own subjective judgements about the editorial standards of highly reputable and professional publications. It is the equivalent of an editor disputing a reference to a professional academic journal on

 Possible cons? 

) What are the failure scenarios for the pre-cooler?  How gracefully/gracelessly will the engine fail?

) Is there a critical point in the mode switch where the rocket mode (and the various cycles that are meant to sustain propellant transport within the system) might not &#34;&#34;bite&#34;&#34;? Again, what is the failure scenario?

I would be happy to see an aeronautical engineer comment on this, even though public sources on how this engine would go arse-up are probably non-existent... (don&#39;t get me wrong, I wish this engine to succeed.)88.110.112.185  &#34;

Can I suggest that (because this article is also included in Wikipedia as a whole) that the wording in this article (and, indeed, the other articles of this type) be amended to include that it is a Virginia area code.  The included map is fuzzy and only really helps if you are familiar with the mid-Atlantic area.  It&#39;s only when you look at the links that you find anything that refers to Virginia area codes.

May Point out that what is economicly good for one is always negitive to another, and yes the idea of the impact of walmart is always going to be a POV because each area of that whole idea is rooted in someones point of view. Now this is what I have been trying to point out for I don&#39;t know 2 years now off and on, you can not look at walmart and say all this critism and then look at target and say its ok for them to do it. that gives a pov right off. We can&#39;t just look at Walmart as alone, because its a branch of the retail it is not alone in most of its practices. And much of the referances here are based on facts put forth by people who stand to gain by walmart having a bad image. That could be Compeditors, Unions, Small Ma and Pa&#39;s. And some of the facts like I have pointed out are just outright frauds. We need this rebuild of this entry to purge some of this garbage info and get this entry back to where it should be.The Ace!

Regarding 1), I think the threshold for inclusion in this article was 50,000 deaths, given that Valentino used that figure in his definition of &#34;&#34;mass killing&#34;&#34;. So listing individual episodes of 50 killings would quickly overwhelm this article given Stalin&#39;s prolific record. 2) I think that approach you describe is okay. 3) If the expulsion of German civilians from Eastern Europe involved mass killing of a significant number of people, then why not.   &#34;

 Macedonian (Greeks) 

Hello, I am disputing whether the &#34;&#34;Preface&#34;&#34; portion should be included in Macedonians (Greeks). I am not disputing ancient times, it is well known the ancient historians distinguished between Macedonians and Greeks, and that Macedonians were Hellenized much like the rest of the ethnicities of the Balkans during that time. 

I am disputing if Macedonians (Greeks) are descendants of the ancient Macedonians, and would like you to prove the Greeks of Macedonia identified as Macedonian during the Greek revolution/Greek battle for Macedonia/nationalism during Ottoman Empire.   &#34;

Actually, a lot of anthropologists would dispute that there are racial gaps in IQ, not least because (as people who actually study the subject of &#39;race&#39;, rather than just making generalisations about it), they are aware that &#39;race&#39; is a complex social construct, rather that a simplistic biological &#39;fact&#39;. Actually, I suspect many would argue that the same can be said for &#39;intelligence&#39; too.

I have shown you my information is more than reliable, but you guys ONLY LOOK FOR THE BAD! you are looking for fault in me, but if you looked for fault on the page itself you would see &#34;&#34;WOW THERE ARE ALOT OF UNRELIABLE SOURCES HERE&#34;&#34; but you wont do that, just to spite me and thats fine, i&#39;m not the one keeping everyone foolish about cocktails.  and btw like there are two drinks or something lol.   there are over 300 recognized cocktails, you cant catch them all, hell you probably only know the names of 50 or so, so thats a good 250 I can edit, so whatever, have your fun, ill have mine, i&#39;ve made a strong argument, proved my information is MORE VALID than anyone elses but you guys are being whatever, there isn&#39;t even a word for that without offending anyone.  Disdainful I guess. Just admit your hating.  I don&#39;t even care anymore, just admit you know my info should be added if all those websites are, you know thats true.&#34;

Why did you alter my message? And you&#39;re calling me an arrogant, ignorant ass? Look at yourself.

I wrote that it&#39;s A PROGRESS, not IT&#39;S IS A PROGRESS or what ever you altered it to.

And even if it&#39;s your native language it doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that you use it better than nonnative English speakers.
I still see errors in your message.

At least use I and not &#34;&#34;i&#34;&#34;.

And again, what is the point of unnecessarily adding &#34;&#34;Cum, leave&#34;&#34;?
And you&#39;re seriously just trying to argue about it, doubting MY own understanding of Hebrew and the circumstances of the title.

Again, once again, I&#39;m telling you the reasons. In Hebrew, &#34;&#34;Ligmor&#34;&#34; (that&#39;s the gerund. &#34;&#34;Gomrot&#34;&#34; is a feminine present (progressive or simple) form) means either &#34;&#34;To finish&#34;&#34; or &#34;&#34;To cum&#34;&#34;.
&#34;&#34;Cum&#34;&#34; is obviously some sort of a slang word, but that&#39;s what Cum and Gomrot is. A word and its meaning. Because the show is about sex, their intentions for the tile are obvious. If you insistingly want that, I can put both &#34;&#34;Finish, Leave&#34;&#34; and &#34;&#34;Cum, Leave&#34;&#34; to show its &#34;&#34;double meaning&#34;&#34;.   &#34;

I would say no. But I might have to change my mind if you can find it in a reputable source, other than a typo.  

I first found it in the Lisp 1.5 Programmer&#39;s manual, there both boolean and boolian are used. Searching google shows that both are in use. Other two links where both spellings are used: Earliest Known Uses of Some of the Words of Mathematics, A catalogue and guide to the Charles S. Peirce Papers

 &#34;&#34;boolean&#34;&#34; or &#34;&#34;Boolean&#34;&#34; 

I believe that the spelling of &#34;&#34;boolean&#34;&#34; should be standardized to be de-capitalized when used in a sentence.  Example: Boolean algebra simplifies circuits.  However, they are expressed in boolean expression.  The word &#34;&#34;boolean&#34;&#34; appears to be derived from the person&#39;s name George Boole, and just like &#34;&#34;diesel&#34;&#34; is derived from the person Rudolf Christian Karl Diesel, &#34;&#34;volt&#34;&#34; from the person Volta, and so on.   
Well, language isn&#39;t always as neatly regular as you might like it to be. The standard usage in mathematics has a capital B, therefore we use a capital B. In computer science, sometimes it&#39;s lowercase, and that&#39;s OK too.   &#34;

You have confused something here. My only edit to the article was to remove the afd tag after closing its articles for deletion debate. Please see the edit history of the article. When you look at such an edit history you can see exactly which actions were taken by different editors by comparing different versions of the article. To see what my edit was, you would check the box just prior to my edit as well as the box next to my edit and then click &#34;&#34;compare selected versions.&#34;&#34; By doing so you would see the actual change I made to the article, which you have not reverted. I believe the edits you are referring to were made by . On a separate note, the current introduction is just about impenetrable and needs a substantial rewrite. &#34;

Hello Darkwarriorblake, in regards to the cast of Prometheus, I ask permission to add bullets to the names of Sean Harris and Rafe Spall. Firstly, I think it would help highlight the information that their characters pertain, and their quotes on the film. I think it&#39;s a safe assumption that the two are relevant enough to be highlighted as the two were named in the opening credits (as opposed to Benedict Wong and Emun Elliot). It would be very much appreciated, thank-you.

Not necessarily, Ethan is still appearing in episodes (at least two more before the end of the season) and has been an important Other since the first season. Anyway, getting back on topic, Pickett was essentially a background character until a couple of episodes this season and it doesn&#39;t look like we&#39;ll be finding out more about him anytime soon. His page is pretty short - I guess a merge back would make sense.

 Finally I only changed the second &#39;paris economy&#39; reference to &#39;industry in the Paris region&#39;. The first &#39;Paris economy&#39; is fine as it is widely understood as such, but the second reference I changed to a) eliminate repetition and b) give the layman reader a cocluding scope of the area we&#39;re talking about - Paris on a map extends only as far as Paris, and we&#39;re talking larger than that here.

Ok, I don&#39;t &#34;&#34;proudly&#34;&#34; use a swear on my page, it&#39;s true I do know a shitload of info for my age (I&#39;m not telling you). I was also annoyed how some users, like you for example, is so uptight about the rules, it&#39;s like &#34;&#34;Come&#39;on give it a rest already. Finally, just because I use a swear does not make all aussie &#34;&#34;blokes&#34;&#34; complete obnoxious people who swear every minute. And you&#39;ve got the wrong idea of civility. That&#39;s all I have to say. &#34;

Apologies Masem, I wasn&#39;t clear and I agree - we will likely never be able to attribute cause to Aspergers or SID.  His illness had probably gone to some form of undiagnosed psychosis (which nobody has stated in RS so we can&#39;t use) but it takes a very serious break to do something like this.  Overall, Aspergers and SID are part of his mental health profile. have been mentioned in RS and that is entirely relevant that we include as part of his overall profile.-

1 Year of the Collaboration of the Week 

Hello again to those of WikiProject Oregon. It is time again for another Collaboration of the Week. The last two weeks were a Stub Improvement Drive, and thank you to those who improved any Stubs.

This week marks the one week anniversary of the COTW, so a brief highlight reel:
At least 10 DYKs
Three articles passed GA after being listed at COTW
Probably around 25 articles started
Almost all Top importance articles are now better than Stub class
And now on with our countdown. This week we have two requests, the Willamette Meteorite and Tom McCall. Hopefully we can get both to GA quality. Click here to opt out of these messages, or click here to make a suggestion for a future COTW. Thank you.

Dear John,
I hope this finds you well. It is nice knowing you through the Bircham International University discussion. I tried to explain my views after your comment (first wrote them briefly and again, elaborated them). I might not be as efficient as you are, but those comments come strait from my heart. Thanking you

Dbachmann, I am not in the least surprised by your civil and composed response.  Maybe Decius&#39; English is no better than his Ancient Greek.  Certainly his seething rage is unjistified, and highly indicative of a person with an agenda, and in denial.  I will read the rest of the talk page at my leisure, because it is quite lengthy.  As for the katadesmos, what is there to discuss?  I already provided a translation in English - would you like me to expand on the Grammar used?  It&#39;s interesting that you ask that the slate be cleaned.  I see nothing on my slate.  If Decius wishes to, he can start by offering apologies for calling me all these horrible insults, and most especially the &#34;&#34;weasel&#34;&#34; part, which came even after his olive branch (the hypocrisy of it!).  He should apologize earnestly, unreservedly and abjectly.  Unless he does so, I will have every right to be calling him &#34;&#34;the Window Urinator&#34;&#34; (his words, not mine).  In the meantime I would like to ask you to take a look at this article-featured external link: http://www.geocities.com/indoeurop/project/glossary/mace.html and comment on it.  I think it&#39;s pathetically amateurish.&#34;

Trouble with refs 

Hi Johan! Do you want a hand with adding that reference in Lake Titicaca? The way you&#39;ve done it at the moment gives it a fixed number which will get out of synch as more refs are added. The trick is to integrate it with the text insoide  ...  tags and let the {{reflist}} template take care of composing the list in real time.

Thank you for this, but, if I understand correctly, you are assuming that the force is proportional to the magnitude of the apparent wind.  But the total force on the sails is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the apparent wind, so the forward force depends on the angle and on the square of the magnitude.  That is the relation that I used for the  135-degree table above.  But maybe I misundertand your formulas and your table.

Spare me the drama and amateur use of legal terminology that you clearly do not understand.  The caption states &#34;&#34;Seventy per cent of [Israeli youth] surveyed reported increased subjective fear or hopelessness.&#34;&#34;  The photograph portrays an Israeli youth, and crouched with the toy gun, gets across the concept of the text.  This isn&#39;t an anti-Arab Israeli commentary (if it wasn&#39;t I wouldn&#39;t have used Arab Israelis to portray Friendship).  David &#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39; &#34;

&#34;::Archont Petar and Petar Gojniković are two different people. Archont Petar was born in ca. 930. Petar Gojniković was born much earlier. Read this line from the House of Vlastimirović article: &#34;&#34;Knez Petar Gojniković (son of Gojnik, grandson of Vlastimir), born ca. 870, ruled 892/3-917/8, captured by Bulgarians, died in captivity. &#34;&#34; Those dates are nowhere close to of Archont Petar&#39;s. All I know for a fact is that Archont Petar died either during or after the 970s. So, please, don&#39;t put false facts in an article unless you do some research. Also, Archont Petar is also called Predimir and in some sources, I am finding the use of Predimir rather than Petar for Archont Petar. This should help.

Comment While the &#34;&#34;it&#39;s the main one&#34;&#34; argument is a nasty one - if the US version was the original (which I&#39;m not rightly sure of), wouldn&#39;t it be the originator? Perhaps the US version should have a section listing the international versions (if related)? Of course, this is all assuming the US one was first and the others are descendants.   &#34;

The page was made by Navdeep55 on 20 March 2007 and you Bal537 came on Aug 2008 and edited the text and added that Ramdasias are chamars. I came after you and reverted back the false information provided by you. You gave link references and I replied to your link references in talk page that you delete and added more link which i reverted back. 

What is the point in  deleting Ramdasia Sikh Gotras and adding chamar link to it. You also did the same in Jatt and khatirs sections where you projected them too  as chamar. You say Ramdasia and Ravidasias are same which is false. You can goto the most popular Matrimonial websites -

http://shaadi.com/

http://punjabimatrimony.com/

Both have separate section for Ramdasia and Ravidasia . The Ramadsia Gotras are aslo different than Ravidasia Gotras .

Ramdasia Gotras: Nar, Badhan, Rajju, Rattu, Heer

Ravidasia Gotras: chumer,Chumber,Singhmar,Sheemar,Jassal ,Jassy Kainth.

The thing you are doing is the thing that most Ravidasias do ie; pretend to be Ramdasia and then spread false info that both are same. This can be see on matrimony websites where for eg  kainth and other listed Ravidasia castes people add themselves into Ramdasia section.

You give references to chamar books and chamar websites and no neutral source that supports your view.

The Fact Remains that  Ramdasia are weavers(Julahas) whereas Ravidasias are chamars(Leather tainers)and both are not same at all.

 your assessment of RSN (&#34;&#34;it seems that the general consensus is that the Sacco book is not a reliable source&#34;&#34;) is just what&#39;s missing from the discussion page. I&#39;m sure you will get a response from the people on the minority of the RSN, but your uninvolved perspective would, hopefully, help promote collaboration and some compromise.   &#34;

- TABThe toy thing I understand you&#39;ve got backup, but Adam 12???? What&#39;s up? There are many web pages that make the connection between Adam 12 and the matador, not to mention the Cox toy whose production was dependent on the product placement, which by the way, increases the notability since somethat happened elsewhere as a consequence. I actually watched Adam-12. Could you adopt a slightly more inclusionist approach, I don&#39;t understand your vision of cutting out to improve quality. It&#39;s pretty clear we can&#39;t put in every mention of a Crown Victoria police car, but for a car as obscure as this one, that makes it notable.  Also up on the talk page. TAB

Top speed was about 125 miles an hour, which took only 43 seconds, much faster than the previous 1970 Plymouth Satellites. These cars would be seen on later episodes of Adam-12, and Pink Floyd The Wall (film). The Adam-12 police car would also be the subject of a now-rare  Cox radio controlled gas powered replica.

&#34;

In the past there was no such nation as &#34;&#34;Germany&#34;&#34;. It consisted of literally hundreds of states, some kingdoms, some duchies, some simply a city. Over the centuries these states fought against each other, allied with each other, and even absorbed each other. Each state was a proper country, and so such names as &#34;&#34;Brandenburg&#34;&#34;, &#34;&#34;Saxony&#34;&#34;, &#34;&#34;Hanover&#34;&#34; etc defined national groupsm and cultures. It wasn&#39;t until 1871 that Gertmany became one country, and even then some regions(eg Austria) weren&#39;t invluded. Since 1871 terms like &#34;&#34;Hanoverian&#34;&#34; and &#34;&#34;Bavarian&#34;&#34; no longer refer to national identities because they&#39;re all just &#34;&#34;German&#34;&#34; or &#34;&#34;Deutsch&#34;&#34;. However, if a foreign non-German people were to suddenly use the name of say &#39;Bavaria&#39; as their national identity, and call their non-German language and culture &#34;&#34;Bavarian&#34;&#34; ALL Germans would take offense to it. This is something of a no-brainer. In exactly the same way, there used to be literally hundreds of separate Greek nations, varying greatly in size, power, culture, and other things. They fought both with and against eaxh other. Today however there is a single Greek state which does not include all the historical Greek lands. However if a foreign non-Greek people were to try and appropriate a regional name that is indisputably Greek(like with Nacedonia) it will understandably anger ALL Greeks. Because Macedonia was one of those hundreds of Greek regional states. What&#39;s more today more than 80 per cent of Macedon proper is within the Greek boundaries, and not FYROM&#39;s boundaries. So thus FYROM has no legitimate claim to use the name &#34;&#34;Macedonia&#34;&#34;, except to describe its southern regions like Bitola and Ochrid(sp?) in a historical context....... Kurt Stein&#34;

Okay thanks, that&#39;s what I was looking for, especially the Newsweek piece which speaks to its importance.  I&#39;ve added text about this to the article, using that and the MIT AI Lab page as sources.  But I&#39;m not sure about using the screenshot; the Flickr image is copyrighted to Casey – was he a federal employee or a contractor? – and the site may have actually been owned by the MIT lab for all we know.  Images put up on congressional websites have often fallen into a grey area in this regard.

&#34;Race &amp; genetics==
Addressing Crusio&#39;s comment, there are markers that could be looked for. for example is the PCSK9 allele, this is all in the context that certain races are more susceptible to certain diseases. Certain races also respond differently to medications. Certain allels are prevalent in only certain races (although there is race mixing as immigration and such, the alleles are still passed on)

I&#39;m sure you all know I&#39;m alluding to NitroMed&#39;s BiDil.

In this case, BiDil seems to help heart failure in african americans more then other races. Should we not research into this? 

Would it be racist to give african americans (in the article, they were &#34;&#34;self identified black patients&#34;&#34;) this medicine?

I think a lot of the stigma around nazi&#39;s and eugenics and racism has halted the academic freedom into research into this matter. People needs to understand that as an academic, one must have an academic view on things. If a particular drug helps a particular race, then why not use it? But we can&#39;t CHOOSE what results produces, we must accept them in order to change. ie. If a particular gene/allele is present in one race that&#39;s lacking in others, I must ACKNOWLEDGE the difference in order to help develop methods to create possible genetic cures.

To turn a blind eye to this is not only limiting academic freedom, but is an injustice to humanity as a whole. An example is seen in the case of Lysenkoism, which caused famines that killed millions.

Did you even read the VARTV article, IF you known anything about radio or have worked in Radio, You would see the information I Provided about WCDX is accurate, Just look at the History of the call letters or why don&#39;t you do the research yourself. Since YOUR right and everyone else is wrong.

You&#39;ve deleted each stations History in the Richmond Market, What have you got again the History of these stations. Maybe you aren&#39;t aware but There was no Clear Channel or Radio One 20 years ago. People who really Loved what Radio used to be enjoy reading the History of the Stations.

Richard the Lionheart and Sex 

You seem like a fair guy, so I was wondering if you could help resolve the tiff between Silverwhistle and I on Richard&#39;s sexuality. I think the problem is that my edits make the straight theory seem bigoted and that Silverwhistle&#39;s make the gay theory seem liberal and fantastical. I was thinking we could pour all our arguments into a new section marked &#39;Sexual Orientation.&#39; Would you support this and help us? How can we resolve this without venom?

TS, this just seems like an anti-Lib trip.

Although I know the last one applies to me, I&#39;m just having difficulty understanding your third bullet point, would you be able to clarify?  Anma I highly advise you follow the first two points as you have unessecarily remove references, then deleted the page in the name of no references, thus I reposted. I&#39;m assuming that was meant by &#34;&#34;baiting&#34;&#34;.  Second at no time did we ever reach consensus as you just came in and removed things instead of working with me to get this right. J thank you for your professionalism and take the time to give your 2 cents, I hoist a goblet to your name.&#34;

What do you mean the source isn&#39;t verifiable?  I&#39;m waiting on a copy from the library.  Unless you&#39;re proposing that the material simply isn&#39;t in the book at all, which seems unlikely, it is most certainly verifiable (going to have to refer you back to wp:v).  The citation needs to be completed (for that one you can see wp:cite).  You first brought this issue up on Saturday, and as soon as I have the book in hand I will complete the citation, but I don&#39;t think any of us are going to spend $50 to get the book overnight simply to see you move on to another straw man.  user:J aka justen (talk)

&#34;:::::Okay, dug a little deeper, and I think I&#39;ve figured out what happened, more or less: Fremantle forfeited their games against Centrals and Rovers in protest to what they called poor umpiring by a Mr. Croft in their previous game against Rovers, which caused them to drop to third on the ladder. The premiership came down to the last match between West Perth and Rovers (not really a grand final, as it was still part of the regular fixtures), which resulted in a draw, 4.10 (WP) to 4.7 (R) – I&#39;m guessing behinds weren&#39;t counted at this stage. Also, I think this comment pretty much confirms it: &#34;&#34;Fremantle supporters will feel very sore at not having any interest in the final match for the premiership. Really they have themselves to blame for the school-boyish behavior they have shown in ignoring the Association.&#34;&#34; Fremantle later challenged Rovers to a premiership decider under any umpire selected except Mr. Croft, which Rovers quite rightfully declined to take part in. Very interesting reading, and that&#39;s my historical research finished for the day ) ♦A

&#34;::::I read the page, PMK1, and it is indeed very interesting, but the only thing that I did not manage to find is any kind of indication of an anti-&#34;&#34;Aegean Macedonian&#34;&#34; governmental policy. The change of toponyms-discriminatory policy connection made by you is at least far-fetched. 
And something else: I do not like to retort to ironies, but PMK1, I kindly ask you not to put into my mouth things I never said. Fairness and democracy were never an argument of mine. So, please, stick to what I actually wrote. I am the last to deny the oppressiveness of the Metaxas regime, but this oppressiveness targeted not the minorities, in particular, but a large part of the population in general. My opinion on the article is already known: I believe it should be incorporated into the Greek Slavophones or merged under a new article, titled per Fut. My opinion on the section in question as long as the article exists is also clear: Accuse the Greeks of what they actually did; not on what you would like them to have done.

 Comment, Clarification 

THis is in response to your message on my user page, which I&#39;ve posted below. Just so you know, I accidentally blanked a redirect page [I was trying to figure out a better way to redirect and accidentally hit save] and then immed. reverted it. I was not vandalizing the page. For some reason, when you look at the history of the page it doesn&#39;t show that I reverted it, but that you did seconds aftervia one of your bots I&#39;m sure. Anyways, I just wanted to clarify situation. The msg you posted on my page was:  
 &#34;&#34;Please do not replace Wikipedia pages with blank content, as you did to the page Category:Authors. Blank pages can confuse readers, and are overall not helpful to the Wikipedia project; furthermore,blanking a page is not the same as deleting it. If the article you blanked is a duplicate of another article, please redirect it to an appropriate existing page. If the page has been vandalized, please revert it to the last legitimate revision. If you feel that the content of a page is inappropriate, please replace it with appropriate content. If you believe there is no hope for the page, please use the appropriate deletion process.   — Jeff G.  ツ &#34;&#34;

Mr Weston as you call him appears to want to rewrite history. He was a notable member of a notable band, and we will be writing about him. If there are any specific statements about him which you feel are both negative and inadequately sourced then of course they will be removed per WP:BLP; beyond that, &#34;&#34;Mr Weston&#34;&#34;&#39;s career as a member of The Orb is a matter of public record. You might also like to advise him that coming here and shouting his filthy mouth off (as he or somebody claiming to be him has done in the past) is likely to be far more damaging to his reputation than fairly tame articles which do little more than say he was something of a production genius in one of the UK&#39;s most acclaimed electronic bands.  &#34;

Well the other editors are clearly trying to mislead the public. As you are right now when you are blocking my very well reasoned explanation 

Some liar, and there is no nodubt whatsoever that this is lying, keeps changing the wording to imply that he knows WITH TOTAL CERTITUDE that the ENTIRE AMOUNT OF THE RECENT WARMING is human-induced. Asking lunatics like this for evidence, with all working out shown, appears to be pointless. The other thing is the campaign against warmer winters for Siberians appears to be self-contradictory. If the entire amount of warming was human-induced that would mean we would have been cooling or on a tightrope to cooling but for the human-influence..... But elsewhere they deny this. So there is no doubt the attempts to edit me lately have been motivated by pure dishonesty. And lets be fair here. My editing is only to do with obvious and known dishonesties. And its incredibly  minimal

Another thought - is describing the word as a &#34;&#34;neologism&#34;&#34; superfluous, perhaps? I&#39;ve always been an advocate of approaching writing a Wikipedia article as if everything you&#39;re writing about happened a thousand years ago and is ancient history, because it seems to me that&#39;s the proper style for an encyclopaedia, which is intended to be timeless and authoritative. &#34;&#34;Neologism&#34;&#34; is an inescapably relative word - *all* words are neologisms looked at from one perspective in time, soon after they are invented. (All the words Shakespeare invented would be neologisms if you lived in 1630, for instance). I sincerely hope this page will be around in some form in another hundred years, at which point homophobia will no longer be a neologism. I think it&#39;s probably sufficient simply to say when and by whom the term was coined. Comments? AW&#34;

I looked into a Dutch newspaper from 20 March 2015, De Volkskrant. It states in Dutch that a journalist has found a metal scrap three months after the crash in a part of the fuselage. The journalist took the piece with him. It has appeared to be a part of a Buk. The Dutch government has not commented yet, at least, I could not find any formal reference, so I am quite sure there is no official publication from the goverment. The &#34;&#34;Onderzoeksraad&#34;&#34; (research council for accident investigation) says they will study the material as soon as it is handed to them and cannot draw conclusions before they have done their own research.

Next, you also say &#34;&#34;now&#34;&#34; for adding ip link, the ip link has been posted 3-4 times in the whitelisting page long before it was added to my userpage, because no one cared about it.

Grab some glory, and a barnstar
Hi, I&#39;d like to invite you to participate in the Guild of Copy Editors July 2010 Backlog Elimination Drive. In May, about 30 editors helped remove the {{copyedit}} tag from 1175 articles. The backlog is still over 7500 articles, and extends back to the beginning of 2008! We really need your help to reduce it. Copyediting just a couple articles can qualify you for a barnstar. Serious copyeditors can win prestigious and exclusive rewards. See the event page for more information. And thanks for your consideration.  Talk! &#34;

 The consensus agreed on earlier was that the NTSB briefings *are* an authoritative source (and rightly so!), they do not need to be separately quoted by 3rd party media/press refs, let alone by questionable blog postings or other &#34;&#34;online media&#34;&#34;. And yeah, I&#39;d expect people to actually have seen all NTSB briefings, otherwise they have really NO reason whatsoever to bother reviewing stuff here - if anybody can&#39;t be bothered to watch the NTSB briefings, then please just read the transcripts. Frankly, it is beyond me how you guys are tolerating this type of workflow and behavior, even perceiving me stating that as an &#34;&#34;attack&#34;&#34;. How can it be an ATTACK to expect people to be familiar with the topic they&#39;re contributing to ? Honestly, all this goes to show the weaknesses and shortcomings of crowd-sourced encyclopedia-writing, there&#39;s no proper hierarchy, and if there&#39;s one, it&#39;s one where seniority and stylistic aptitude count more than a factual background. Yeah, this is kinda disappointing.  &#34;

 Sure, what we&#39;re looking for is reliable sources. That means we&#39;re looking for guarantees of reliability in the source, like having been published in an academic journal. Further, we want to avoid sources that represent only one person&#39;s view on the topic, since we&#39;re obviously not going to have a paragraph on everyone who&#39;s ever said anything about Hamlet. What you&#39;ve added isn&#39;t backed up by a reliable source, since from that YouTube video, we have no idea who this person is, why he&#39;s talking about Hamlet, or if anyone else believes what he&#39;s saying. That&#39;s why we want to see academic journals. Even if his ideas are published in academic journals, we&#39;d want to see citations to that work to determine that it&#39;s sufficiently notable for an encyclopedia, and not just one person&#39;s view. agtx &#34;

Thryduulf, I want to apologize for my lack of participation on this project. I&#39;ve been completely preoccupied with urgent personal matters, and my Wiki work has been reduced to a mere trickle. (I haven&#39;t even addressed the other changes I&#39;ve discussed for the personal- and geo-name song lists that were due by now.) I&#39;ll jump back in as soon as I can, but it&#39;ll probably be another week or so. Meanwhile, I hope you, Grutness, and others are finding this work illuminating. —  18:01, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)

I&#39;m not removing any sourced content. Have you read the sources? The &#34;&#34;92% approval rating&#34;&#34; came from The Harvard Alumni association in a personal letter of congratulations; One of the sources on his human rights record was written by an undergrad student at Penn State University. The sources are obviously extremely compromised, and you respond by removing this well-cited passage (from NPR, LA Times, and Foreign Policy Magazine, no doubt)

López played a leading role in the 2002 Venezuelan coup d&#39;état attempt against President Hugo Chávez, where as mayor of Chacao, the wealthiest district in Caracas, he lead protests and conducted civil disorder to the level of which NPR states &#34;&#34;culminated in an attempted coup against Chávez in 2002, and even personally detained the Minister of Interior and Justice Ramón Rodríguez Chacín during the events of the failed coup attempt.

Any article on L&#39;Heureux-Dube is incomplete without some discussion of her role as one of the most dedicated enemies of Charter rights ever to sit on the Court  and that is saying something for such a profoundly illiberal institution as that.

Socking and edit warring is not the answer==
I just wanted to put a note here, for folks who are apparently so angry that Wikipedia says there are &lt;9000 jews in Iran that they are opening    (all blocked) in order to make it not say that, and folks curious about it.   I suggest the socking user find more constructive ways of contributing - there are many.  I think the consensus view is that we&#39;re not being arbitrary and we&#39;re not censoring; we have articles that say it had more Jews and are open to having articles report that Iran has far more Jews than the articles now say it has, provided it is verifiable to a source that trumps the actual, official, recent government census.  This has been discussed here and elsewhere, including talk pages linked to from this section (that is, #Iran).  The claims of a larger presence could be noted if, for example, there are verifiable sources that say that the numbers do not include significant numbers of Crypto-Jews living in Iran. (t•c)

 Deletion of section on Possibility of Mars having enough water to support life 

I&#39;d like to point out that BatteryIncluded has deleted this section. I won&#39;t try to argue with him because I have had a fruitless argument on the &#34;&#34;life on Mars&#34;&#34; page on this very topic. He is convinced that the cosmic ray arguments that make dormant life impossible over hundreds of thousands of years periods in the surface of Mars also make it impossible for life to survive even if reproducing every year (although cosmic radiation levels on the surface are comparable to the interior of the ISS). I gave up arguing the point with him.

However I&#39;d like to point out that there has been a major conference earlier this year in February (with 38 scientists presenting the results of their researches) [The Present-Day Habitability of Mars 2013 - Program]

You can watch the video presentations and decide for yourself if the current prevailing scientific opinion is that the surface of Mars is potentially habitable or uninhabitable. It is true that before the Phoenix lander possible salty brine observations in 2008 the prevailing view was that life on the surface of Mars is impossible. But that is no longer the consensus and it would be hard to find a single researcher in the field who holds that opinion today. I have put a copy of the section into my user space as I frequently use it for reference and found it a useful resource. Please note I did not write this section myself, only added a couple of sentences to it.

Thanks, I appreciate your kind words. Some of the ideas I have in mind are: 
 adding information concerning online copies of journal papers (lots of journals publish at least a part of their papers online for free - the system should inform the user that at this and that url there is probably a online copy). 
 more or less automatic updating of the db according to the growing use of ref templates in WP articles
 extending this to multiple Wikis, e.g. German, French etc. (need multilanguage support, but also separate wikilinks according to language etc.)
 extending this to other areas, Physics, Computer Sciences etc.
 user management, which will become necessary when the DB gets the attention of vandals etc.

And in the title of the entry for &#34;&#34;National Socialism&#34;&#34;, they write &#34;&#34;also called Nazism or Naziism&#34;&#34;. 

Your claim that use of the term &#34;&#34;Nazi&#34;&#34; is amateurish is a slur on the overwhelming majority of scholars who routinely use the term. The claim that &#34;&#34;National Socialism&#34;&#34; is a &#34;&#34;more full and correct designation&#34;&#34; is inconsistent with the fact that the two phrases are synonymous. And while it is true that &#34;&#34;Nazi&#34;&#34; can be used as an epithet, so can &#34;&#34;dog&#34;&#34;. Do you also recommend that Wikipedia refrain from using the word &#34;&#34;dog&#34;&#34; to describe dogs? 

It is interesting that you use Linder as support for your argument. The particular passage that you link to is an explanation by Linder as to why he will use the term &#34;&#34;Nazi&#34;&#34; rather than &#34;&#34;National Socialist&#34;&#34; throughout his book. I fail to see why this is evidence that Wikipedia should do the opposite.

I am curious about your statement that use of the term Nazi arises from a deeper intent by political opponents to give a skewed view of their politics. What part of Nazi politics do you feel has been skewed by their political opponents?

Muktananda is a controversial figure and the siddha yoga group has tactfully tried to use the goodwill of bhagawan nityananda to the benefit of their group.Siddha yoga itself has nothing to do with Bhagawan Nityananda who was never assosiated with any religious group.He was wondering yogi not a person who founded any organisation.Many of nityananda&#39;s other disciple have criticised muktananda trying to hog the limelight by claiming that he was nityananda&#39;s most favoured disiple.Just to maintain the non controversial nature of Bhagawan i as a honest admirer beleive that the siddha yoga template  does not do good to the nityananda article.

You have recently deleted my comments on another user&#39;s talk pages, which is a serious violation of Wikipedia&#39;s rules.  Also stop vandalizing the links for the Marl Kingdom games.

Attention Used Asswipe 

For the love of God, please stop banning my accounts from seeing the light of day. So far, you managed to murder Steven1350, Steven13500, and Steven135000. Now I am forced to use Steven1350000, and believe me, those zeros can grow to be quite lengthy if you keep banning me. Believe me, I can get so many unique IP address&#39; that banning me is a waste of time (since you see I am already on my 4th user account [and I couldnt care less for your policy on that]). Showing off my number of banned accounts to all my friends is fun, so if you wanna play it that way, remember that you have an audience rooting for you

And another thing. You wiki admins are all Caption retards. In the page http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_checkuser/Case/Mattkachu , you claim that Mattkachu==Steven1350. This is completly wrong....and you should use powersander to take the idiocy from your face.

Please feel free to comment on my usertalk page, as I am in dire need of a good laugh from an nice empty threat you people like to send me so often.

PS....do you have any peanut butter, cuz I could go for a nice PB &amp; J sandwich about now

Hello, the Heleen Mees article is now full of nonsense. Mees never was an employee of the european Commission, the 2006 article about women (not) working was not her first article in NRC Handelsblad. She had published quite a bit before that. Also, the article includes vicious and superfluous references to the stalking charges that are set for dismissal and is quite unbalanced. The following would be a much better text:

Heleen Mees (born Heleen Nijkamp, 1968, Hengelo)[1] is a Dutch opinion writer, economist and lawyer. She has been credited as being a third wave feminist.[3]

Biography
Mees graduated in Economy and Law at University of Groningen. From 1992 to 1998, Mees worked for the Dutch Treasury in The Hague. From 1998 to 2000 Mees worked as a national expert for the European Commission in Brussels.[5] In 2000 she emigrated to the USA, where she changed her surname to Mees.[6] Mees lives in Brooklyn, New York.[2]
Mees&#39; breakthrough as an opinion writer in the Netherlands came in 2006 when she wrote The time is long overdue that women should go to work.[8] That same year, she co-founded Women on Top, an organization that until 2011 advocated more women in top jobs.[9] 
From 2006 to 2010 Mees wrote a bi-weekly column in NRC Handelsblad, and from 2012 to 2013 for Het Financieele Dagblad. Her work has been published in the Financial Times, Foreign Policy and other international newspapers. Currently she is a columnist for Project Syndicate[11] and the German magazine Capital. Mees is the author of three books. 
Mees has been president of the New York chapter of the Dutch Labour Party (PvdA) in New York. In 2008, she worked as a volunteer for the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton.[12]
In August 2012, Mees completed a doctoral thesis at the Erasmus School of Economics, focusing on the effect of China&#39;s economy on the emergence of the 2008 global financial crisis.[13] While completing her research, she worked as an Adjunct Assistant Professor at Tilburg University.[14] From September 2012 until July 2013, Mees was employed as an Adjunct Associate Professor of Public Administration at New York University&#39;s Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service.[15]
In July 2013, Mees was arrested in New York on charges of stalking her former lover, the chief economist of Citigroup, Willem Buiter.[16] In March 2014, the court decided that the case against Mees was to be dismissed in one year provided that she complies with two conditions.[17]

First of all, the user shouldn&#39;t have came to me on a verbal aggressive way and could of said it the alternate way, which he failed to do so, and I responded back at his comments and gave him a fair warning if he tries to f*** with me again. I&#39;ll bet he won&#39;t like it and back away from it. 

Anyways, regarding about the 2000 New Flyer C40HF buses (5000-5222) they were at divisions 3, 5, 7 and 18. Although, a few of them were at SGV-3 division, when they were brand new and entering into service in the early 2000s, before being sent to divisions SB-5 and WSC-7. If you haven&#39;t noticed, a few of their cousins C40LF buses were at the same division they were, since one 5300 series bus was on line 180 in the early 2000s, when it was brand new. So, it wasn&#39;t the C40HFs that were at D3, their cousins were, too. 

Yeah, SB-5 division did have a few of the New Flyer D40LF buses (3000-3019) at one time, before they were sent to WSC-6 for almost their whole life, before 3 or 4 units were sent to Veolia Transportation (a bus contractor) in 2009 or 2010. I remembered riding one of those D40LF buses on line 115, when SB-5 used to operate that line, shared by SB-18,  which currently owns the line.

Btw, thanks for sending me a message in a civilized matter.  After all, me and you have had verbal altercations in the beginning over bus stuff and changes.  But it&#39;s all cool now, right?

That&#39;s what we&#39;re supposed to do in the case of a content dispute. Yes, I know, that is so hard to learn! Another moron example of how admins are the sickness of Wikipedia.

Well, I&#39;ve been complaining at the federal level since 1992 about sex discrimination, and my great grandmother, Dr. Beatrice Gelber&#39;s, probably one of the women you &#34;&#34;admire,&#34;&#34; a famous psychologist.

Your young age

I&#39;ve figured out what makes you so &#34;&#34;interested&#34;&#34; in that donkey punch article.  It&#39;s your age.  You&#39;re a minor.  A child, in other words.  You&#39;re under one or both ages of majority in the United States, 18 or 21.  I suspect you are a high school student under 18.  Earlier, you claimed to be &#34;&#34;Steven Andrew Miller, a student living in Printer&#39;s Row, Chicago.&#34;&#34;  Most university students advertise their university affiliations.  You didn&#39;t.  Makes me think you&#39;re a child.  So, just how young are you?  People should know whom their dealing with, so they don&#39;t get in trouble for using profanity to a child or insulting a child or saying negative things to a child or whatever is illegal with children nowadays.  It&#39;s problematic to deal with children on the internet, and you should put up a userbox indicating your age to avoid those problems.  &#34;

&#34;Possibly unfortunately, I created C++ class to be a redirect to this article. Then again, this article would be a bit strange if it were titled &#34;&#34;C++ class&#34;&#34; without its contents being changed to refer to classes instead of structs for most of the article. 

I&#39;m not sure what that example was there to prove. I didn&#39;t know that would work, but it doesn&#39;t change the fact that the struct and class keywords aren&#39;t literally interchangeable (you can&#39;t cast a struct A* to a class A* when only a struct A type has been defined, for instance).

Sudhir, I too sometimes wish that wikipedia pages could be frozen in the versions that I like, but alas wikipedia rules and ethos stand in the way. )
More seriously, I assume you are referring to this version of the page that was last edited by you. I haven&#39;t read that version completely, but the Early Life section in it was largely sourced to:
 Samrat Hem Chandra Vikramaditya By Samrat Hem Chandra Vikramaditya Dhusar (Bhargava) Memorial Charitable Trust (Regd.), Rekmo Press, New Delhi: I haven&#39;t seen this work, but the listed author suggests that it is a community history, which for the same reason as ML Bhargava&#39;s book, is deprecated on wikipedia.
 Anokha Aarohi by Kranti Trivedi: This is a work of fiction ! 
Please take a look at WP:HISTRS for why we prefer academic histories and modern scholarly works in writing wikipedia articles. That is not going to change anytime soon, and I don&#39;t want to give you false hope that the Early life section can be edited to resemble the version it was on Sep 22 last year.

I have absolutely no connection to this subject, and am indeed preparing to write stories about other crooners as well. I think you may be inadvertantly &#34;&#34;making the guy look bad&#34;&#34; by having banners like that showing up on his page, and it concerns me about creating pages for other crooners if my research will be demeaned. Pardon me if I&#39;m good at doing my homework. I am more than happy to scan and email my ID, or sign a notarized statement with proof of my identity (or even Skype) should anyone feel the need for such confirmation. My screen name was &#34;&#34;Croonerman&#34;&#34; long before I&#39;d ever heard of this singer, and the only reason I did was because I searched my long held screenname of &#34;&#34;croonerman&#34;&#34; on Google. I use that name as I am a fan of crooners in general, including Frank Sinatra.   &#34;

Krishnendu das aka Babukishan comes from an old and very traditional Baul folklore family. His grandfather, Guru Shri Nabani Das Baul, was a much celebrated singer and poet that was instrumental in bringing the Baul culture to fame with the respected and admired status it enjoys today. Nabani Das Baul often collaborated with the writer of India&#39;s National Anthem, a great poet, and winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1913, Rabindranath Tagore. In popularizing the music of the Baul. 

Nabani Das Baul opened the doors for his people to the world. In keeping with this tradition. Babukishan&#39;s father, Samrat Purna Das Baul, a modern, popular legend among the Bauls, opened up the doors even further by collaborating and jamming in live performances with the top Western and European acts of the 20th century. Babu is a music designer, singer, and author renowned in India for his work in both the recording and film industries. He plays a variety of music combining new age, and world fusion, with traditional folk music in authentic Bengali Baul style
Babukishan began his career as a performer by accompanying and studying the arts with his father, Purna das Baul. He also participated in numerous youth folk festivals, traveling to places such as Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Bangkok, Great Britain, all of Europe, the United States, and Canada. He played with both the Asian Performing Arts Festival at the Royal Albert Hall in London and the Worldwide Youth Festival in Carnegie Hall in New York.

From this beginning, he traveled most of the world from 1980 to 2000 as a composer, music instructor,musician. and singer.

Babukishan, deeply inspired by his Father and Grandfather, knew at an early age he too wished to compose and perform. He began on the soil of Bengal but clearly he was destined to belong to the world of music. His journey started in early childhood when he joined his mother, Manju Das, and his father, Puma Das, playing and singing Baul music in global festivals. Despite the many world tours, Babu also found the time to study Indian philosophy and Folk music at the University of Kolkata where he eventually secured both his BA and Masters degrees. 

So it was that his formal professional career in music began with his family. He toured with Bob Dylan&#39;s The Band East &amp; West tour in 1985. In addition, Babukishan has performed with other international artists such as Alice Cooper, Rolling Stones,Tom Petty, Miles Davis, Allan Fakir, George Harrison, Herbie Mann, Third World, Robbie Robertson, Garth Hudson and many others. 

Though the subsequent years, Babu put this solid foundation in music to good use by composing and performing in all areas of India&#39;s entertainment industry as well as in a variety of venues worldwide. Then, in keeping with his early dreams of a unique style of his own, he turned to the music of the western world that he had become so familiar with in his early years of performance. His use of Baul &amp; Indian rhythms combined with the Reggae produced his own brand of World Music-Babu&#39;s New Age, Bengali Folk Fusion is the result. 

Babukishan has also worked with top Indian musicians/singers and music directors such as R.D.Burman, Ravi Shankar, Sultan Khan and Zakir Hussain. 

As a composer, Babukishan has written the music for several albums, TV serials and films, earning a good reputation as one of the most promising composer in the Bollywood (Indian cinema) music &amp; film industry of India. In his recordings, Babukishan features folk music, romantic songs, pop songs, ghazals, Qawwali music, new age, fusion, Sufi music and bhajans (devotional/spiritual songs). He is the first singer and music composer from the rich Baul family tradition to venture into fusion music by combining Baul/Sufi music with western music and reggae music. Babukishan produced and directed two documentary films about folk music and he wrote a book titled The Bauls of Bengal. One of Babukishan&#39;s latest projects is the band &#34;&#34;Birds&#34;&#34;, which he founded. It combines new age, world music/traditional folk and fusion music. His album Soulmate&#34;&#34; (Universal/Music India) creates a unique new generation music worldwide.and his latest album, Birds &amp; soul mind &amp; body are based on Baul/Sufi music.&#34;&#34;GYPSYINDIA&#34;&#34; is authentic traditional baul &amp; sufi music written/composed and all the instruments played by him.this album recored at woodstock,newyork during his tour on 2004.

 he helped inaugurate the national haiku societies of several countries... 

This article is coming together nicely. I&#39;ve been toning down some of the more over-enthusiastic language and adding citations, and am now trying to find refs to &#34;&#34;he helped (in 2000) inaugurate the national haiku societies of several countries (Australia, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Serbia, Slovenia)&#34;&#34; which is a fairly substantial claim and so needs support. On the &#34;&#34;about&#34;&#34; page at the website of the Australian Haiku Society mention of Kacian is curiously absent, and we read simply, &#34;&#34;In December, 2000, Australian haiku enthusiasts banded together to form HaikuOz&#34;&#34;; regarding Slovenia, we read on the site of the German Haiku Society that &#34;&#34;The Haiku Club of Slovenia (HCS) was set up in September 1997&#34;&#34; i.e. 3 years prior to Kacian&#39;s trip; in Serbia, there are two societies: the Aleksandar Nejgebauer Haiku Club was formed in 1993 according to their page on Templibres, and the Serbian Haiku Society was founded in 2004, according to this page on Tempslibres. According to this page on WHC, the Bulgarian Haiku Club was formed in 1999. 

In light of all the above, we&#39;re going to need something more than a statement from Kacian himself if we want to retain this claim. Can anyone help?  &#34;

 Your edits to Washington, D.C. 

Hi. Thank you for the good faith improvements made to Washington, D.C.. However, the changes have been mostly reverted for the following reasons:
All new information must have sources that correspond with WP:CITE.
Per WP:SUMMARY, the main article on Washington, D.C. provides only a summary of information and does not go into very many specifics, unless it is considered to be a &#34;&#34;major&#34;&#34; aspect of the city. Since hurricanes and noreasters are rare, they are only mentioned in passing. In our efforts to maintain Washington D.C.&#39;s Featured Article status, the editors typically revert edits that would expand the information beyond what is required by WP:SUMMARY. Along these lines, storms that have hit D.C. are not mentioned because A) there is already a subpage on the subject (List of Maryland and Washington, D.C. hurricanes (1980–present)) and B) since we can&#39;t mention every storm, we mention none of them. It is also the reason &#34;&#34;noreasters&#34;&#34; aren&#39;t defined in detail, because there is already an article devoted to them, which users can read to find more information.
The article is on Washington, D.C. itself, not the surrounding area. Therefore, any information about what happens in the suburbs or the nearby coastal areas is not included in this article.
If you have any sources with information that you believe is absolutely necessary for understanding D.C.&#39;s climate, please make it known. Best,   &#34;

Early life

Hanssen was born in Chicago, Illinois, to a family of mixed Danish-Polish and German descent. His father, a Chicago police officer, was emotionally abusive to Hanssen during his childhood.[7] Once, for no known reason, Howard Hanssen arranged for his son to fail a driver&#39;s test. In later life, Robert Hanssen speculated that his father had done this in order to &#39;toughen him up&#39;. The elder Hanssen constantly disparaged his son and said that Robert would never make anything of his life.[8]

Hanssen graduated from William Howard Taft High School in 1962 and went on to attend Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois, where he earned a bachelor&#39;s degree in chemistry in 1966. While at Knox, he took an interest in Russian through elective courses. It was also at this time when Hanssen applied for a cryptographer position in the NSA but was rebuffed due to budget setbacks. Originally set to become a doctor, Hanssen took the opportunity to enroll in the dental school at Northwestern University.[9] He did well academically, but said that he &#34;&#34;didn&#39;t like spit all that much&#34;&#34;.[10] He switched his focus to business after three years,[11] and received an MBA in accounting and information systems in 1971. After graduating, he took a job with an accounting firm but quit to join the Chicago Police Department as an internal affairs investigator, specializing in forensic accounting. Hanssen left the department after two years, joining the FBI in January 1976.[7]

Hanssen met Bernadette &#34;&#34;Bonnie&#34;&#34; Wauck while he was attending dental school in Chicago. Bonnie was one of eight children from a staunchly Roman Catholic family. The couple married in 1968. After Hanssen married, he converted from Lutheranism to his wife&#39;s Catholicism, becoming a fervent believer and being extensively involved in Opus Dei.
[edit] Early FBI career and first espionage activities (1979–1981)

Hanssen joined the FBI as a special agent on 12 January 1976 and was transferred to the field office in Gary, Indiana. In 1978, Hanssen and his growing family (of three children and eventually six) moved to New York when the FBI transferred him to its field office there.[12] The next year, Hanssen was moved into counter-intelligence and given the task of compiling a database of Soviet intelligence for the Bureau. It was then, in 1979, only three years after joining the FBI, that Hanssen began his career as a Soviet, and later a Russian, spy.

That year, Hanssen approached the GRU (the Soviet military intelligence agency) and offered his services. Hanssen never indicated any political or ideological motive for his activities, telling the FBI after he was caught that his only motivation was the money.[13] During his first espionage cycle, Hanssen told the GRU a significant amount, including information on FBI bugging activities and Bureau lists of suspected Soviet intelligence agents. His most important leak of information was the betrayal of Dmitri Polyakov, code named TOPHAT. Polyakov was a CIA informant for more than twenty years before his retirement in 1980, and passed enormous amounts of information to American intelligence while he rose to the rank of General in the Soviet Army. For unknown reasons, the Soviets did not act on their intelligence about Polyakov until he was betrayed a second time by CIA mole Aldrich Ames in 1985. Polyakov was arrested in 1986 and executed in 1988. Ames was officially blamed for giving Polyakov&#39;s name to the Soviets, but Hanssen&#39;s role remained unknown until after his arrest in 2001.[14]

Hanssen was nearly exposed in 1981, when Bonnie Hanssen caught her husband in their basement writing a letter to the Soviets. Hanssen admitted to her that he&#39;d been giving information to the Soviets (motivated purely by his &#34;&#34;need&#34;&#34; for money) and that he had received US$30,000 as payment, but he lied and said that he was only passing along false intelligence. Knowing this, Bonnie insisted that her husband go to confession, as is required in the Roman Catholic faith for those who have committed serious sins. The Opus Dei priest who allegedly heard Robert&#39;s confession is said to have told him to give the money to charity as an act of penance. This remains unconfirmed as under the Seal of Confession, it is absolutely forbidden for a confessor to betray in any way a penitent in words or in any manner for any reason&#34;&#34; (Canon 983.1) under penalty of &#34;&#34;latae sententiae excommunication (Canon 1388.1). Hanssen told his wife that he gave the money to Mother Teresa, but it is unknown if he actually did so.[15] Hanssen then stopped spying for the Soviet Union until 1985.

&#34; Untold Story&#34;&#34; appeared, in November of 2009, the authors&#39; website stated: &#34;&#34;We are dilegently trying to prove the true family of Christopher Columbus by concrete scientific methods including DNA analyses that are ongoing at the University of Granada and other forensic means&#34;&#34;. (It still says that!) The DNA evidence, at the time of the book&#39;s publication, four months ago, was inconclusive. Now, four months later, he says that he has &#34;&#34;proof to assert that the man who discovered America wasn&#39;t a peasant&#34;&#34;. &#34;&#34;Assert&#34;&#34; is just a &#34;&#34;declaration&#34;&#34;. He also says after 20 years of research he can &#34;&#34;claim&#34;&#34; his investigation as the truth. A &#34;&#34;claim&#34;&#34;, itself, is not, at all, any type real proof. We&#39;re told above that Columbus&#39;s real name was Segismundo Henriques, son of Vladimir lll, of Poland. Yet, the website contradicts this, by telling us that his real name was Latin; &#34;&#34;Colonus&#34;&#34; and &#34;&#34;Colon&#34;&#34;. Which is it? It&#39;s all much too uneven, contrived and catchpenny. This&#34;

 As a side note this was the edit not the one you provided and M has stated before that it&#39;s the official national anthem.

Hi. The billboard photo of Maddy and the number to call is under consideration for deletion on Commons and thats not good since most other madeleine pages has that picture.

What is your intention with this text??, as you give no reason why you are introducing this. This is a talk page, so you obviously have some intention to the mainspace text. What is the aim??
 Contentwise: This seems to be a conspiracy theory that takes in a lot of wild allegations. Combining these wild rumours in such a way is at best original research, at worst slander. Neither has a place in a mainspace article 
 Even if you dig up all the journal papers you are implying, this would still be original research as the synthesis of the sources in such a way is not obvious. So it will not be enough to provide a source for each line, you will need to provide a reputable source that combines them in the same way as you do. Without such source, this text is wild allegation.

The way the orphaned talk pages are found is through the human eyeball  unless you want to write some sort of script that finds them. Go to it, it&#39;ll save a lot of trouble, but until then, this is how I&#39;m doing it.

As for my errors, that&#39;s five or so out of  what?  1-2,000 that I&#39;ve tagged. Considering that the error rate for the deleting admins  who should have been deleting the pages to begin with instead of relying upon people like me to sweep up after them  is closer to 1% to 5%, depending, perhaps your advice has higher priority targets.  | Talk

Jehovahs Witnesses and blood transfusions
Thanks for your assistance at improving this article. I am happy to provide any of the reference material cited therein if and when you choose to continue on the subject, and hopefully you will continue. This subject material is similar to other religious issues—there is much emotion and consequential contentious behavior. The remedy for an encyclopedic entry is reliance on reputable and verifiable sources that present objective information. This particular subject is extraordinarily serious because it involves life and death medical decisions. Hence the need for an even higher standard of seeking sources of information with no history of hostility toward one view or another. Again, thanks for your assistance.

Threats to block me from editing wikipedia now.  Well done Damac- your baiting and harassment campaign paid off!  Oh, when you block me? please revert all the articles i&#39;ve contributed to back to the state they were in before I completed work on them. Be Bold!

Blocking me would have the bonus of somewhat preventing Damac exercising his flair for harassment and baiting of serious contributors however.  Of particular enjoyment to me where his accusations of copyright infringement and plagarism- mentioned on wikipedia:civility?  Funny though how Damac&#39;s allegations, the campaign of officious &amp; inaccurate &#39;editing&#39; (really just rearranging my efforts) he unleashed, the spamming of my talk page desipte requests not to, and the constant snipes aimed at baiting &amp; harassment seem to be perfectly acceptable.

I&#39;m not really sure there&#39;s more to explain, Geo, and am surprised you wanted further clarification.  To me, it read like consensus was in firmly favour of deletion.  If we solely counted numbers, it was 15 to 7 in favour of deletion, and given that many of the keep arguments were quite flimsy (Keep, it is notable summed up a few of the arguments, and one was even down as a &#34;&#34;weak keep&#34;&#34;).  I hope that clears things up. If not, you have every right to request a formal review of any deletion at Wikipeda:Deletion review.  ☎ &#34;

Yes it was sourced to a blog, but I think it was reliable.  It has been published on the blog for a year and it is sourced to a court transcript. The pro se litigant was a Yale grad. The blog owner is a 3rd year law student and I don&#39;t think he would misquote a federal judge.  Isn&#39;t there a way to use that source, with whatever notations?

My statements of views are merely responding to yours.  You write &#34;&#34;I did write that the CA rule creates a double standard, because it does. It says one set of rules governs how the court must act when all parties are represented by counsel, and another set applies to pro se litigants.&#34;&#34;.  I don&#39;t think that is true. What rule are your referring to?  To the best of my knowledge all the written rules are exactly the same in all courts for both pro ses and attorney except for 1.) ECF, which pro ses are frequently not allowed to use, 2.) pro se forms, which  pro ses aren&#39;t required to use.  An attorney could probably use the pro se forms if they wanted. 3.) appellate appendixes  in pro se cases the entire case file is sent over and there is no provision for joint appendixes, a disadvantage for pro ses.  There are also other procedures for pro ses, which are not in the rulessee the appellate procedures which I quoted from the case manuals. As I read the California manual, it seemed merely to instruct the judges to provide more explanation.  I don&#39;t remember reading anything that seemed to indicate that a pro se paper would be processed but the same paper from an attorney would be dismissed.

Criminal legislation is supposed to be clear.  A crime is supposed to be a crime no matter who does it unless they are mentally ill or a child.

If someone is jailed for disrupting a court, the Federal Rules require that the court say what the disruption consists of, so there should not be a question of what it was.

Please give me an example of a court order that you think a person can be jailed for not obeying, other than not paying alimony or child support, or not testifying when subpoened about a crime or not responding to a subpoena by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.   &#34;

They express their ancienty and genealogy as ethnic group even not Arvanitic speaking because of repression. In their site they may write Greek but look carefully there is Arvanitika inside and they give very well the answer that their belong to Pelasgian origin.  Whether the Illyrians are a pelasgic tribe this is another discussion. Things will change for Greece if you continue the repression.

The view you express are you own view and do not forget that in civilized word racism is consider a crime.  And more is against your own identity which is unwise. Dodona

Ron Francis Trade Citation

I figured it would be a good citation since this link has copies of articles directly from The Hartford Courant.

What proof do you have that Nowruz is Persian holiday?? You are allowing the false information to be presented to the public? There is certainly no evidence of holiday to be of persian, iranian or zoroastrian origin. I goes back to the Sumerian festival of Akitu (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akitu). Persians came to the plato along with other iranian speakers after the ancient civilisations were already established there. Aryans certainly changed the name of many geographic locations including the names of holidays. I believe any reference to Persian or Iranian must be amended with word &#39;Near East&#39; or at least Iranian plate as in reference to the geographic location rather specific ethnicity.

Okay, that&#39;s fair. Let&#39;s proceed at GA without the info included. I think this is reasonable since his ntability is derived from his WW2 actions which are covered.

&#34;I didn&#39;t make this up.  You act as if it is my definition.  It is not.  I went to dictionary.com and wanted to know if it agreed with the only definition you provided.  (Not &#34;&#34;yet another&#34;&#34; as you might imply.)  The way you want the word to mean doesn&#39;t mean that it really does mean only that. You pointed them as disparate and used a dictionary as an authority.  I don&#39;t believe them to be disparate and other dictionaries show that they are not. - τ

I think there&#39;s a difference between &#34;&#34;product placement&#34;&#34; (which is taking money from sponsors to feature their products in a show, often with cross-promotion - ie. James Bond and BMW) and using name-brand products in a show to give it authenticity. It&#39;s jarring when a couple of wealthy guys are sitting around drinking no-name beer, as we&#39;ve seen in the past. While some may doubt whether the spokespeople are telling the truth, the article should only feature sourced information. If it deserves mention in the article at all (which I&#39;m dubious about) it should be something like &#34;&#34;Sopranos is known for featuring name-brand products such as cars and clothing labels prominently. Spokespeople for HBO and the various products claim that no money is involved in these appearances, which are used to give the show a sense of authenticity.&#34;&#34; - a &#34;

Overlooked topic in the &#39;The Chronicles of Narnia&#39; article? 

Hi,

I&#39;m not sure how to ask/bring this up, but I was wondering if there is some mention due to the supposed late night conversation/apparent wager between C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien that purportedly spurred each man to create their respective masterpieces, The Chronicles of Narnia and The Lord of the Rings? 

I had heard various iterations of this from different sources over the years and recently found this article on the topic:

I notice there is already something cited there: &#34;&#34;However, as the document points out, the distinction between εκπορεύεσθαι (ekporeuesthai) and προείναι (proeinai) was not made in Latin theology, which used the same term, procedere, to denote both realities. Is this enough to explain the insistence of the Latin tradition on the Filioque? Saint Maximus the Confessor seems to think so. For him the Filioque was not heretical because its intention was to denote not the εκπορεύεσθαι (ekporeuesthai) but the προείναι (proeinai) of the Spirit.&#34;&#34;. But I still believe a more explicit citation should be found (or Maximus&#39; view should be made more clear.   &#34;

 You are now a Reviewer 

Hello. Your account has been granted the &#34;&#34;reviewer&#34;&#34; userright, allowing you to review other users&#39; edits on certain flagged pages. Pending changes, also known as flagged protection, is currently undergoing a two-month trial scheduled to end 15 August 2010.

Reviewers can review edits made by users who are not autoconfirmed to articles placed under pending changes. Pending changes is applied to only a small number of articles, similarly to how semi-protection is applied but in a more controlled way for the trial. The list of articles with pending changes awaiting review is located at Special:OldReviewedPages.

When reviewing, edits should be accepted if they are not obvious vandalism or BLP violations, and not clearly problematic in light of the reason given for protection (see Wikipedia:Reviewing process). More detailed documentation and guidelines can be found here.

If you do not want this userright, you may ask any administrator to remove it for you at any time.  —  &#34;

Please stop stalking me
My brother may think you are an alright well intentioned editor. I do not. I believe you wish to cause drama and put the focus on you. To start a problem with a &#34;&#34;new person&#34;&#34; with meaningless and unnecessary threats and then run to an administrator to coddle you. Following someone around and undoing everything they do, acting like a Wikipedia snitch and getting involved in things that don&#39;t involve you. That&#39;s trollish and stalkerish. All because I deleted my own comment and offended your opinion of right and wrong? Seriously, please stop stalking me. I agree with another editor as to the value of something in an article and YOU pop up to put me in my Wiki-place? I quit Wikipedia once already because of people like you, please stop trying to run people off. I do not have the time nor inclination to deal with you. Please.. go away. - 98.214.81.82  &#34;

Well no, actually I don&#39;t accept edits like those are acceptable and I assure you it won&#39;t happen again if you should reduce the block period to a more reasonable expiry. I was however very very angry when I made those moves because all I could see was two bullies never to have touched the Stevie May article continually reverting my edits using rollback and other slimy methods and never providing a summary other than vandalism being removed, yet nobody explained the vandalism to me. Meanwhile, when I did remove vandalism myself, those two restored the very same. I was mainly working from an old revision of the article and as you will appreciate, other editors inserted the info I was restoring and nobody at any time commented on what was wrong with it.

I&#39;m nearly certain that Scott Thornton didn&#39;t become an alternate captain until Craig Conroy was traded to Calgary.  I sure can&#39;t recall him wearing the &#34;&#34;A&#34;&#34; on his jersey before that moment, and I also thought I heard on a Kings telecast shortly after the Conroy trade Bob Miller and Jim Fox talking about how he&#39;s now wearing the &#34;&#34;A&#34;&#34; on his jersey, leading me to believe that he assumed that role after the trade.

Re: Portal:Poland 

Hi Szafranpl and welcome to Wikipedia! I&#39;ve taken the liberty to reword your edit so that it conforms to the general format used here, but otherwise it&#39;s a great addition to the portal. I didn&#39;t know Poland was so strong in gliding, so I&#39;m glad to see those results here. I&#39;m also happy that someone has finally added something to the portal, because most of the time it&#39;s just me maintaining it, so I may inadvertently bias the portal towards my personal preferences. Thanks a lot and hope to see more of your edits! — (talk)

Regnerus Study: Criticism 

Previous versions of this article unnecessarily multiplied references to criticism of the New Family Structures Study. 

First of all, this article is ostensibly about the Witherspoon Institute, not the New Family Structures Study, and it does not make sense to devote so much space to one study in what is otherwise a small article about an organization that has done many other things, as mentioned in the earlier paragraphs. 

Further, there is already a reference to the fact that the Study received criticism, down toward the end of the article. That same sentence also refers to the fact that many scholars also voiced praise for the Study, and thereby gives much more balance than the earlier discussion of criticism.

The fact remains that the Study was published by a peer-reviewed journal and was conducted at a major research university that has not condemned it. Some people voiced concerns to the same university that the study had not been conducted properly and the university found that the concerns did not merit further scrutiny. This Study has received the same vetting that countless other academic studies have received, including ones that came to very different conclusions.

In short, previous representations of criticism in this article about this Study were unnecessarily long, presented the Study in a very biased light, and made this article into a forum for voicing opinions that is properly handled in the academy through the methods of peer review and institutional review that the Study already passed. By ignoring those very processes of review such discussion does a disservice to Wikipedia&#39;s readers and suggests that the critics have a problem with the academic review processes as such, not the New Family Structures Study itself.

A serious question
You obviously enjoy being as nasty as you possibly can be in &#34;&#34;acceptable&#34;&#34; ways that don&#39;t threaten to get you blocked.  My question is don&#39;t you ever get tired of being dead wrong about so many things, so often, in such a needlessly nasty manner, and so publicly in front of your fellow editors? Vandals suck.  Eight year olds with access to the internet suck too.  But it&#39;s people like you who maintain a facade of respectability while being absolutely horrible to other people who are really the worst members of the Wikipedia community. -  &#34;

Oppose. A move to inconsistency would be a bad thing in this case, but I do feel that 1) the sheep article could be improved by highlighting more strongly that it&#39;s not about domestic sheep (and that there is a difference), and 2) some sections in domestic sheep need to be moved to the parent article.  The current arrangement works for me.   ≡ talk

(edit conflic) I don&#39;t quite understand why you and Madcoverboy are after this article. I&#39;ve created it following a request, and provided sources for it (the Interactive Policy Making Initiative is mentioned in the Register source). I just can&#39;t see what harm it can do, Madcoverboy said it was written like an ad, but how can that be? This software is developed internally by the EU and is not on sale, so why would anybody want to advertise it? Then you&#39;ve nominatted it saying it&#39;s a non-notable website or company, but it&#39;s none of this - it&#39;s a software. In other word, the article is not spam, not ad, there&#39;s no COI, and it was requested by another person (proof that some people want to know what it is about). So I&#39;m sorry, but I&#39;ll keep removing the deletion tags - I suggest you bring the article to an AFD if you so badly want to see it deleted.

&#34;
please observe these Wiki guidelines on the Pro se page

In the Wiki model, an article which may currently be poorly written, poorly formatted, lack sufficient sources, or not be a comprehensive overview of the subject, can be improved and rewritten to fix its current flaws. That such an article is lacking in certain areas is a relatively minor problem, and such articles can still be of benefit to Wikipedia. In other words, the remedy for such an article is cleanup, not deletion.&#34;&#34;

&#34;&#34;But the purpose of an encyclopedia is to provide information: the potential readership or subjective usefulness of each item does not have to be justified if the material is notable.&#34;&#34;

&#34;&#34; while some editors may dislike certain kinds of information, that alone isn&#39;t enough by itself for something to be deleted. This may be coupled with (or replaced by) the unexplained claim that they feel that the information is &#34;&#34;unencyclopedic&#34;&#34; (see #Just unencyclopedic, above). Such claims require an explanation of whichpolicy the content fails and and explanation of why that policy applies as the rationale for deletion. (See also #Pointing at policy.)&#34;&#34;

&#34;&#34;Wikipedia editors are a pretty diverse group of individuals, and potentially, any subject or topic may be liked or disliked by some editor somewhere. However, personal preference is not a valid reason to keep or delete an article.&#34;&#34; &#34;&#34;It is insufficient to simply assert that an article (or the subject of an article) is not appropriate for Wikipedia.&#34;&#34; &#34;&#34;The debate is not a vote; please make recommendations on the course of action to be taken, sustained by arguments&#34;&#34; and the same applies to all deletion debates. Any statement that just consists of &#34;&#34;Keep&#34;&#34; or &#34;&#34;Delete&#34;&#34; with a signature can easily be dismissed by the admin making the final decision, and changing &#34;&#34;Keep&#34;&#34; to &#34;&#34;Strong keep&#34;&#34; will not make it any more relevant. Try to present persuasive reasons in line with policy or consensus as to why the article/template/category/whatever should be kept/deleted, and try to make sure it is an argument based on the right reasons.&#34;&#34; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arguments_to_avoid_in_deletion_discussions    &#34;

, please unblock me. I&#39;m serious about never editing again. Let me finish what I came to start, and then I won&#39;t bother you people anymore. This is seriousness taken to the top. I&#39;m fed up, exhausted, and irritated. I don&#39;t feel the need to be here anymore. If you just let me finish one FAC and somewhat tidy one other article, I will leave you all. I won&#39;t compromise this any other way; I&#39;m letting you have what I know that you want to have: the departure of me. You know you want this, and I know that I want this too since I won&#39;t have time to edit for four months. When I come back from Japan, I&#39;ll be too tired to even want to return to Wikipedia — just let me do this, because if you don&#39;t, I&#39;ll be gone and Cool (song) and We Belong Together won&#39;t be completed.

Sir
I am not a vandal. I am only trying to make sure the page is restored to how it was orginally. Some other users have taken it upon themselves to make personal attacks on this individual and that is not right. They have used dirty tricks to see that I was blocked from just taking out the word contraversial.

Personal Information on your UserpageTAB
Hi . I don&#39;t intend to scare you away or attempt to intimidate you, but I thought you might want to reconsider some of the items on your userpage. You may have not realised that the items on your userpage release personal information about yourself (real name or age etc), which could be used against you in the future. While 99% of all the editors on Wikipedia are friendly, welcoming and harmless, there is a chance your personal information could be misused by editors not so &#39;high-minded&#39;. A handful of editors have even felt real-world implications due to their Wikipedia edits and release of personal information. 

I have deleted some revisions of your userpage in respect to your privacy for the time being, just in case you wish to reverse on your decision to have such content on public display. As a result, the information is only available to administrators. You are, of course, welcome to ask myself or another administrator to restore them, but I just wanted to make you aware of the risks involved with releasing personal information on such a public forum. If you wish to to have the personal information removed so that even administrators cannot view it, I can request oversight on your behalf. You are also welcome to discuss this with me on my talk page, or privately via e-mail if you have any concerns. Hope to hear from you. \  / {talk}

 Bluegrass and country music 

This paragraph is problematic and ill founded &#34;&#34;These styles are known because of the importance of Irish and Scottish people in the English speaking world, especially in the United States, where they had a profound impact on American music, particularly bluegrass and country music.&#34;&#34; The people of Appalachia are not Celts or Gaels; they&#39;re Anglo-Saxons from the Scottish Lowlands, as well as Ulster-Scots and Northern English.

I am going to point out that, by your own logic, this article should be moved either to Volksetymologie, since that logocentric originary-story is your key justification for the exclusivity of the term to linguistics, or to False etymology, since linguists, unlike folklorists, insist that the etymology be factually incorrect. However, I suggest doing neither of these things, because the simple empirical situation before us is that the term is used, and has long been used, and is authoritatively defined, in two distinct but related senses in two distinct buyt related disciplines and this is where users would ordinarily look up either sense. It is hgih time you all dealt with the evidence you yourselves demanded of me, and put me to the work of gathering, before moving the goalposts.   18:19

Woohoo, I don&#39;t know the procedure here. What do you suggest..arbcom case or mediation? Should we get a meditator?

They are not all experts. The guy who was supposed to be the Mafia/Italian american expert/historian was just an actor who majored in history in college. I checked his website and IMBD page. He had no scholarship that would prove him to be an expert on italian americans, teh mafia, or weapons used by the mafia. He did however have a cameo on Entourage. There are plenty of university professors and ex-military guys Spike tv could get. But they are probably not good infront of the camera of aesthetically pleasing. Yeah some are experts, but a lot arent.

 Ain&#39;t bothering me, I&#39;m not required to sign my posts/edit. I didn&#39;t specifically threaten anyone and your blowing it out of control. It was a snide comment.

My ISP has been causing problems. This may explain malformed links. Its a wireless system. Four times already, techs tried to fix it, and it still acts up from time to time. Among other malfunctions, it has even kicked me literally off the &#39;net, and I have to wait until it is fixed. It picks up data from a satellite, then it rebroadcasts it to devices that people purchase, as if they were radio trancievers, which they are.

That is a good thing though. ) IMO a CSD should be easy enough for someone to understand who may not always be involved in that area. It is more of the wording though. Not talking about a fair use image that is orphaned, not talking about a blatant copyvio as that is covered, not talking about a WP use only as that is covered. Really it is only for otherwise &#34;&#34;properly&#34;&#34; licensed, &#34;&#34;user created&#34;&#34;, images that have been orphaned, or were never used, that would serve no use outside of the deleted (or non existent) article.

&#34;==Notability of Michael capponi==
 A tag has been placed on Michael capponi requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a real person, organization (band, club, company, etc.), or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject&#39;s importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article.

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or &#34;&#34;db&#34;&#34; tag), coupled with adding a note on the article&#39;s talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don&#39;t hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject&#39;s notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.  -WarthogDemon &#34;

There is no need to do a bunch of original research into the theology of the Unification Church. It appears that you can find church members with a range of views, as with other religions. Moon himself says that he does not deny evolution. What difference does it make whether the church is for or against evolution, whatever that means? Wells has evidently been influence by his theological beliefs. That is the relevant point here.

Actually, I wanted fix cluebot to be a separate edit. I forgot that I was in the undo editing template. You can argue if it&#39;s inappropriate all you want. The real issue is that it&#39;s spot on and will lead to Xenophrenic being less of a disruption while he&#39;s POV pushing.

This article is horrible... this page is an example of &#34;&#34;wikipedians&#34;&#34; forcefully suppressing opinions that disagree with their own under the pretense of objectivity. Check the page history for numerous rebuttals that don&#39;t mesh with the &#39;party line&#39; on acceptable portrayal of the issues and rebuttals. Instead they opt for people who do not have English as a first language to provide a clumsy perspective...

 Reply to your request for help 

I have read your request for help on my talk page. Although I normally prefer to answer a message on the page where it was posted, on this occasion it seems to me that it will be more helpful if the information I give you is on your talk page for future reference, so I am copying your message to here, and replying here.   

Please note that we are from digital agency and Stayfree India given us instruction to create the page for the stayfreewomenforindia and it is not for the promotion of the product but it is for the good cause of the women in  India . I really don&#39;t know who on the Stayfree page in the wiki , the wiki user is promotion. We can send you the content for the approval . It is genuine and original content for the periods , how to cure on those days . We would like to make awareness to women to use sanitary pads because it is very safe for the health.
 
Please let us know how we can add the content for women care in wiki . If you need we can use the J&amp;J; official id for this page . Hope to get the positive answer from your end  — Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

Clearly you are acting in good faith, attempting to serve a useful purpose in informing people of information that stands to benefit their health. Unfortunately, however, this is an example of exactly the kind of thing which Wikipedia does not do, and it conflicts with several of Wikipedia&#39;s policies and guidelines. You are clearly intending to use Wikipedia to host a page about a product to publicise it. Whether the motivation behind doing this is to increase profits of the company making that product or &#34;&#34;for the good cause of the women in India&#34;&#34; is irrelevant: Wikipedia is not for use to promote anything for any purpose. To put the same thing another way, the policy that Wikipedia is not for promotion applies just as much to promotion of good causes as it does to promotion of business interests. Trying to increase awareness of health issues in a population where there is widespread ignorance of those issues is no doubt a worthwhile thing to do, but it is not one of the things that Wikipedia does.

You should also be aware that editing on behalf of a business or organisation to write about a subject in which that business or organisation has a direct interest is brings you into conflict with Wikipedia&#39;s conflict of interest guidelines. A Wikipedia article needs to be written from a neutral point of view, and if you are writing on behalf of someone else in order to publicise a subject they are involved with, it is likely that you will find it difficult or impossible to write from such a neutral point of view. (In fact, in this case it is clear that you do not even wish to write from a neutral point of view, since your declared aim is to portray the campaign as a good thing.)

&#34;&#34;Stayfree India&#34;&#34; has used several Wikipedia accounts, which have been blocked from editing, because their only purpose was using Wikipedia to promote their cause. They have evidently approached you to edit on their behalf, to continue the attempt to promote their cause. Under Wikipedia&#39;s policy on  abuse of multiple accounts, if any account is used to make edits on behalf of a blocked editor, thereby helping the blocked editor to evade the block, the account used for such purposes can be blocked too, as it is being used to circumvent Wikipedia&#39;s policies. As I said at the beginning of this message, I have no doubt that you are acting in good faith, and that is why I have taken the time and trouble to explain to you what the issues are, rather than simply blocking your account. You are welcome to contribute to Wikipedia on other topics, where you do not have a conflict of interest, would not be helping to evade blocks on other accounts, and would not be promoting a cause. However, continuing to edit in ways which conflicts with Wikipedia&#39;s policies in those respects will not be acceptable.   &#34;

Numbers are wrong 
In the citiation that gave for Mizrahi population in Israel there is no number (here:http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-32796203_ITM) and in the last demographoc statictis that was published even in the Demography of Israel article is showed that the number is around 2.9 million not 3.1 million include the Sepharadi Jewish population
And also for France and Morocco the ethnic idenety for Jewish population wether they are Mizrahi or Sepharadi is uncertained cause the Moroccan Jews are both Sepharadi and Mizrahi

I know but only some stations had it the 11th. The 11th was only a sneak peek and then the season officially started on the 14th. If you look at tv.com it has it listed as the 14th. Also since some stations had there program sechedules messed up, I say lets have it say the 14th. I did get a hold of WGBH and they did say it was a sneak peek. The site just said when the season was kind of starting. Also, the episode aired omn the 11th and then reaired on the 14th with the rest of of season. Lets see what other people say about the date and we can maybe change it but for nw leave it. You seen to be the only person to have a problem with it being the 14.

Dear Hammersoft,

Iv been repeatedly using the logo of the Chennai Super Kings in the Twenty20 article for a variety of reasons.Let me tell you, the Indian Premier League is the largest domestic cricket tournament ever.It has a wide mass publicity and massive revenue with players all over the world taking part.In fact it even surpasses the World Twenty20 Championship itself.But there is nothing much mentioned in this article excepting a few lines along with other Twenty20 leagues which are significantly inferior.So i hereby felt that the Indian Premier League will get a better propaganda(rightly it deserves especially in this article) if one of its team logos were used in this article.

As for the image, I have no other choice as there are only a fewer images uploaded based on this article.

Depolarization
When looking at the page depolarization it says that depolarization is only when voltage is heading towards zero volts and never when it is not. So once it crosses zero volts it is actually repolarizing. I&#39;m not an expert on this but there is a very long discussion on it in the site I mentioned, It definitetly needs to be fixed.

Week 1 

It has been one week since this three week block was imposed and I declared my departure from this project (for many more reasons that simply the block itself). I see there has been activity here since that time; thanks to each of you who commented. Taking my own reflections, as well as those added above, into account, I have come to a new conclusion: I will again volunteer my efforts to Wikipedia. However, I will only do so if the odious, and equally ridiculous, charges and sentences of stalking and harassment are rescinded and declared an error. Whether or not the block is lifted is a matter for others to decide; regardless of the outcome, I will still refrain from editing beyond this page for the next two weeks, and, following that, remain on the 1RR etc. restrictions earlier imposed until their agreed upon time of expiry. I hope others are still watching this page, and I will check in here to participate in discussion, should any follow.

&#34;==dont leave==
Wikipedia needs people like you. Remeber a time when there was no content on Hinduism in Indonesia, Gedong Bagus Oka and Parisada Hindu Dharma ? Remember a time when Category:Hindu politicians was a small struggling cat? Remember a time when Category:Hindu monarchs had no members, its thanks to us that these cats and these areas are encyclopedic now, and will continue to be down the road.man 

indonesia
We should start working on the Indonesian articles again. Tokoh Indonesia is a good resource. See id:Pengguna:Tokohbaka. The good part is that Sanskrit derived words are ok in Indonesian, making it easy for us to contribute, and its in Latin script. Mostly I add Category:Tokoh Hindu to pages.man

 Hindutva propaganda 

What is your opinion on this, it&#39;s a phenomenon ripping Wikipedia apart from the seams, with fanatical supporters of Swami Vivekananda and his RSS revising history  to make people believe lies. Think of all the children that enter Wikipedia and see this revisionist history and will need deprogramming in the future. I commend our maintsream admins. I support the neutrality and common non-OR sense of our admins. By the way, did you know that Swami Vivekananda himself used to write propaganda and publish it in Voice of India. —The preceding unsigned comment was added by 58.178.139.138  .

 National stubs 

Hi there,

Just a small suggestion: When you stubsort (such as you did in the article Hinduism in Tanzania), please include the national stub (Tanzania-stub in this case). Good work otherwise. Thanks 

Religious Articles
You&#39;ve tagged a lot of religious articles, particularly, but not limited to Catholic articles, for lack of notability. Some of these might have been taken from the Catholic Encyclopedia. What do you expect for reference material? Explanation of religious organization is fairly basic to society. The articles could be much better referenced, I suppose. Do you have a good example someplace of what you are looking for? 

For example, you have tagged the first Catholic diocese in the US, Baltimore, for lacking notability. Are you just tagging American dioceses? I am interested in your thoughts here. Are you looking for lots of footnotes? External references?  

Thanks. The Jesus Christ article can have

 Does not anyone read Wikipedia guidelines and rules?  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons

Wkipedia&#39;s own guidelines sumns up the problem here very well:

People who are relatively unknown (Non public figure = NPF)
Policy shortcut:
WP:NPF 
Wikipedia also contains biographies of people who, while notable enough for an entry, are not generally well known. In such cases, exercise restraint and include only material relevant to their notability, while omitting information that is irrelevant to the subject&#39;s notability. Material from third-party primary sources should not be used unless it has first been published by a reliable secondary source. Material published by the subject must be used with caution. (See Using the subject as a source.)

Material that may adversely affect a person&#39;s reputation should be treated with special care. In the laws of many countries, simply repeating the defamatory claims of another is illegal, and there are special protections for people who are not public figures. Any such potentially damaging information about a private person, if corroborated by multiple, highly reliable sources, may be cited if the Wikipedia article states that the sources make certain &#34;&#34;allegations&#34;&#34;, without the Wikipedia article taking a position on their truth.&#34;

The article is incomplete, and poorly written. Nevertheless, it&#39;s better than many &#34;&#34;Culture of&#34;&#34; articles for Western and developed countries. This gives me some hope. The articles for Culture of France (a well-known &#39;Old World&#39; culture), Culture of the United States (the home of many en. editors), and Culture of Japan (appealing to the tech literate set) are the standards that I am aiming for. Many people suffer from the delusion than you can find any information on the internet - in fact, the internet just magnifies the interests of internet users. The WP:CSB project is not working too well, because the aim of getting information which is not already on the internet is not emphasised. -  &#34;

- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Richard001 made a threat of violence against me. Tim Vickers just erased my comments on his discussion page concerning Doug youvan, NukeH, MsTopeka, Hrafn, etc. Hrafn now claims to be retired. Hrafn has a Richard Dawkins&#39; anti-Christian POV filling many articles with secular fascism similar to 1935 Germany. This time it is against Christians. Godwin has his law, saying that such a comment creates a losing argument. Again, the connection (funding) from Homeland Security / Defense to WP /GOOGle, using US Treasury money to ban free speech on WP is Sedition of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. That is a high crime; you are playing with fire; there will be Hell to pay for this in front of a future Congressional committee.&#34;&#34;

You need to really&#39; give up this mindless crap. There is nothing illogical in my position, it is you that needs to grow up. A pressure group that dopes not speak for the people of the area has registered a flag with an organisation who&#39;s rules show it is biased towards the same view. It is you and you little clique that are trying to impose on people there view of where people live. You want to label one set of Cumbrians are Westmorlanders because at some point in the past HMG created an area and named in Westmorland, which it has now abolished and some people still wish to use the old mode. No one has held a public vote the only things that matters in this is what HMG has said. Most people in Merseyside I identify more strongly with Merseyside than any other county, that is there identity. I have seen no evidence other than that 2 pressure groups want to enforce there view. The flag did not belong to the County When is existed, it hasn&#39;t been created for or by an organisation with any mandate. I know people who live in all parts of Cumbria and never has one of the refereed to Westmorland or Cumberland in any context in the past or present. It is some fantasy of yours that you speak for the majority of several areas without showing any evidence or having any mandate. I suspect you rather old and stuck in your ways and can&#39;t abide change and that this is what is atthe root of you misguided POV. HMG had a mandate, you do not and neither does the Westmorland society or the Flag Institute.

If you look at the edit history for the Human Aftter All page, you&#39;ll notice that your additions to that article were removed by someone else.

Aha, as I suspected.  Here is a reasonable presentation of that court case. metnews  It presents the situation far differently than is stated in the article and far differently than Armstrong implies.  The case itself happened 25 years ago.  2006 - 25 = 1981.  The various appeals and countersuits have gone on for years.  The most recent one is that the original attorney is attempting to get more than the $100,000 he recived, whew, what can you expect from attorneys?

Sorry for the late respond, but that was the fact which I was questioning. The text has already been adjusted to make it more neutral.

&#34;
Yes, exactly. The material in the lead just summarizes, in one brief sentence, the later paragraph on Boswell&#39;s material. That is what the lead is supposed to do.
On the blog, first, it does not mention Sergius and Bacchus, the subject of this article. It&#39;s just a general criticism of Boswell&#39;s ideas; the mere fact that an image of the saints appear on the cover of his book is immaterial. Moreover, it&#39;s a self-published blog and not acceptable as a source here. Time to move on.
Your current addition of the Harvey is also redundant, as we already say that &#34;&#34;Boswell&#39;s methodology and conclusions have been disputed by many historians&#34;&#34; and include six citations for it. Ironically, you are only adding more weight to this particular part of the article. t/c &#34;

Peer review from Vision 
Hi Paul,
At first glance your theory page seems to be really rich. However, after reading the lead part, I have to agree with you that the language is sort of unclear. More importantly, my feel is that it reads like fragments mixed together but not well integrated. Therefore, I suggest that you may want to work on better summarize the theory and make it more like an article than excerpt. 
Another suggestion from me regards the structure. Obviously, the sections after Criticism of the theory were not organized logically. (For example criticism of the theory itself shows up twice.) I think you have done a great job in your page edit outline in describing how you are going to restructure it. 
Also, I just want to mention that you bonus analysis of talk page is really fascinating!!! I might do a similar analysis as well, because it addresses some general concerns from a community that not only read the article but also try to enhance it.

By the voting, or &#34;&#34;voting&#34;&#34; only one user have read what I said, and partially agreed with me. All the others has the wisdom the they do not need to read anything, to know wheter it&#39;s right or wrong. If you&#39;re not intrested, and openly admit that you won&#39;t read what I wrote, than why the hell are you chopping in? Having a desire to annunciate the unappealable? ) Ridicuolus, that those  try to act like judges, whom are not intrested in reading more than half the case. Or brings their own laws, showing them as some kind of WP policy. Other wants to be funny, by sending me to uncyclopedia, but he&#39;s just ridicuolus. I can not decide, wheter to cry or laugh out loud. This worse than a joke, this is deplorable. Content dispute is still nowhere been discussed, just my statements.

 Why LaVey anyway???? 

Well, so far, Reason Rules. The Neutrality sticker is still up, though LGagnon threatened, I believe, that it would only be temporary. Intellectually, I am actually rather satisfied to leave it at that.

But - Not!!!!!!!!! For one thing, I enjoy intellectual duelling much too much. All Hail Wikipedia! Ah, for the days of learning for the sake of learning!

I raised the question as part of my pursuit here: why LaVey? Why not Timothy McVeigh? Again, there&#39;s not enough room for everyone, so how were the selected selected? We know who is included. Who was excluded, or perhaps simply &#34;&#34;non-included,&#34;&#34; i.e; unintentionally, in contradistinction to intentional exclusion?????!!

What is more, in view of the evolution of terrorism – to all intents and purposes –  virtually morphing  into a veritable weltanschauung, Timothy McVeigh takes on a new urgency, relevance and intellectual/philosophical challenge.

My fear is that the whole effort is loaded, biased, in violation of Wikipedia rules. The whole thing seems to be a charade to ride satanism in on the ratiocinative coattails of Objectivist Ayn Rand. Otherwise, again, why not Timothy McVeigh? Again, he explicitly mentioned, and is often discussed in terms of Randian libertarianism. She would disown him like a Bolshevik, of course, but then she would disown LaVey in utter disgust!!!! So, if there&#39;s room only for one of the two, why LaVey?

If I don&#39;t receive reasoned responses, I will edit LaVey out again. Again, boys and girls, my emphasis is on a truly Wikipedian neutral POV. AOluwatoyin

Oh, by the way, regarding my being blocked  on grounds of incivility, no less  LGagnon who started all the trouble, on the other hand, does not get blocked? He who refers to admins as &#34;&#34;vandal-coddling&#34;&#34;??!!! That&#39;s not &#34;&#34;incivility&#34;&#34;?!!!! Such revolting double-standards will not stand.

Wikipaedia has an article on Hone Harawira which might prove helpful in addressing this issue. However, such utility may be limited by that article&#39;s content on Hone Harawira&#39;s life as an activist focuses primarily on his participation in an assault on some engineering students:
In 1979 Harawira was part of a group which confronted drunk University of Auckland engineering students who performed a parody of the Ka Mate haka with obscenities painted on their bodies. The group containing Harawira assaulted them with baseball bats and hoses, resulting in several broken bones.
Regardless, Hone Harawira is described as a &#34;&#34;Maori activist&#34;&#34; because his political activism has been almost exclusively on &#34;&#34;Maori&#34;&#34; political issues.

 Send this to User:Bumpusmills1 

Pass this information to Bumpusmills: You have 2 hours to leave wikipedia. The events of the past 2 or 3 days was just a warning, as you said. I think you know what we&#39;re talking about. We have your personal information, your parents personal information, your workplace contact information, a lot of your records, and your wife&#39;s name. If you do not leave wikipedia, we will continue this effort with increased vigor. You have crossed paths with one of us and harassed us. Apologies will not work. Only leaving wikipedia will. If you do not leave wikipedia within the proscribed time, then further action will be taken. Your workplace will be called by gay escort services asking for you, your parents will get letters in the mail under your name saying you&#39;re gay, ads will be placed on gay forums with your contact information, etc. This could get nasty.

You are to delete your user page and replace it with a message that you are leaving wikipedia, never to return. This is to be done within 2 hours. Don&#39;t bother reporting this IP to the FBI, because it&#39;s tor and as a result, it&#39;s untracable.

Once you leave, we will forget about you and we&#39;ll all go our separate ways, never to talk again. I&#39;m really sorry it has to come to this, but your harassment was just too much. Hopefully it never has to come to this again. &#34;&#34;Wado.&#34;&#34;

P.S. For future reference, it&#39;s not a good idea to have your personal information all over the internet if you plan on harassing people. Unfortunately you harassed the wrong group of people.&#34;

Well the censue bureau has never been that smart. San Jose is infact the largest and prime city in that particular region and has been for 10 years, but the census guys still haven&#39;t gotten with the times on that either. In this case however I-75 ends 15 miles from the Miami city line, in Hialeah. Why beat around the bush?  t c 17:48

YOUR PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS: SOME ADVICE

Dude, I am looking over your extensive edit history, and I want to share some guidance that no one else may have the guts or, more likely, care enough to do.  You are quite obviously a very, very, very sick person.  I can&#39;t even begin to imagine the scene: you sitting in your closet of a house editing this site all day with intensity and your eyes glued, looking for the next battle and declaring these little wars over nothingness.  What posseses you to waste your life this way?  Do you get laid?  Do you need further explanations as to why you are wasting oxygen and DNA with your efforts?  Do you have anyone who knows you waste your life like this?  Please don&#39;t be offended.  But please just stop.  You have a very serious illness.  See a psychologist but, for God&#39;s sake, peel yourself away from this web site and do something with your life before it&#39;s over and your are forgotten for the nothing you ever did and the nothing you ever became.

Mutual masturbation has nothing to do with masturbation, it is non-penetrative sex. The word &#34;&#34;masturbation&#34;&#34; is only used as a euphemism, just because handjob and fingering are similar to the way a male or famale masturbates. Mutual masturbation is actually handjob and fingering, which of course is non-penetrative sex, not masturbation! Mutual masturbation is not about two people sitting opposite to each other and masturbating without touching one another, this is nonsense! If no contact exists, this is simple masturbation, no matter how close two persons are to each other. No contact = Masturbation. Contact = &#34;&#34;Mutual masturbation&#34;&#34; (euphemism for handjob and fingering) = Non-penetrative sex. I hope you understand the difference!

 rename aussie film list index 

Sorry, I&#39;m on the fence with that one &#34;&#34;Index and resources&#34;&#34; kind of longwinded to me, difficult to get to easily (without redirection). But I completely agree with you as to what the page is, it&#39;s partly disambiguation and not useful for much else except for the links... Maybe also, (although controversial as to what to list) the page could summarise the influential films for that country in a concise list of around top 10-30 films of notability or really made an impact on culture?? But then I guess that&#39;s what the cinema of Australia article is for... yeah I&#39;m not sure about that particular title, but I think it might be better to steer it into something... Maybe it should just be a disambiguation page and the links and resources might be better suited on the Cinema of Australia page?? &#34;

Russell was active in the Fabian socialist movement.  His political thought was certainly very sympathetic to many technocratic ideas, but was generally more abstract than any ideology.  Roads to Freedom makes patent his political promiscuity: Russell was willing to support any movement that would tend to push history towards human freedom, humane social relations, and the rational satisfaction of human needs.  (Although when nuclear war was concerned, he seemed to prefer social injustice to complete ruin).  On the other hand, Russell was deeply skeptical of technology and science in its influence on human society and culture.  The Scientific Outlook was his vision of a scientific dystopia—one which incorporates much of technocracy.  (For the uninitiated: it is somewhat similar to Brave New World).  Although the technocratic elements are not necessarily portrayed in a negative light, they are not left blameless for the resulting society.  All in all, it seems hard to imagine that book could be the work of an enthusiastic technocrat. — 06:39, 27 January 2007

Factual dispute 

By the late 19th century, the Qing Dynasty began training and creating New Army units based on Western training, equipment and organization.

Is that correct? I think we are not being told about the whole story. In any case, there is no source to support it.

I did not neglect to mention reliable sourcing.  You deleted the references in this talk page commentary!  Click on the links, and you will see the reference.  The cited reference claim you added for &#34;&#34;population density&#34;&#34; as the reason fails fact checking, if you will but click on the D*** reference that you inserted into the article.  There is no personal point of view at issue here; stop the false accusations.  Just look at the reference for the statement that you put into the article for the cite that you put in;  the cited reliable source reference doesn&#39;t say &#34;&#34;population density&#34;&#34; is the issue, but, rather, that &#34;&#34;gang violence&#34;&#34; is the issue.  If you want to add other sources for population density, too, that would be fine.  But, don&#39;t claim a cite says something it does not.  You have been repeatedly warned about sticking to the sources.  This is but another example of you failing to stick to the sources.    &#34;

 The main things I disagree about the Haunted Castle post... 

&#34;&#34;No one realized that lives had been lost until later that night, when firefighters searching one of the burnt-out trailers discovered the bodies, thought at first to be mannequins.&#34;&#34;

This is not true. This was reported in our local papers as well. The night of the fire, the media were told almost nothing, and had to go by rumor. I spoke to the fire chief, as well as numerous others on the scene that night. You see, except for the extreme rear portions of the back of the trailers, where the walls were not made of plywood, everything except metal had been disintegrated to ash. The bodies were discovered before dark, as soon as the fire was extinguished, not much later in the night.
The firefighters knew that what they were dealing with were human remains: bones, blood, jewelry and even unburned clothes and wallets inside pockets on those insulated on the bottom of the pile. (I&#39;ve seen the photos) Additionally, the stench of burned flesh was overpowering, being noticed by patrons exiting the park from the main exit, separated only by a chain link fence from the Haunted Castle trailers. Wax mannequins would have been long-since melted. 
The truth is that the management at first claimed (and might have believed) to firefighters that they had evacuated all patrons from the HC, and there was no reason to close the park. The  castle was isolated, so the fire couldn&#39;t spread to other buildings. The fire was out by 7:45, and the park closed at 8:00 p.m. I&#39;ve never heard of SFGA kicking everybody of the park during an otherwise fairly busy night, with fair weather with a free return pass. An unprecedented decision was made and implemented in 15 minutes. Given this time frame, they clearly found the bodies instantly, and there wasn&#39;t time to think that they were &#34;&#34;mannequins&#34;&#34;.    

&#34;&#34;Eight days after the fire, a statement by the Ocean County Prosecutor&#39;s Office said a 13-year-old boy had called the police after hearing radio reports that investigators were looking for witnesses. The boy told the police that he had been befriended by a 14-year-old boy at the castle&#39;s entrance. He said the older youth, who appeared to be familiar with the castle, offered to guide him through. He said the older youth used a cigarette lighter to find his way down a long corridor that was dark because of a malfunctioning strobe light, and eventually bumped into and ignited a foam-rubber wall pad. The prosecutor exonerated the older youth, who has never been identified, of any criminal wrongdoing.&#34;&#34;
Police knew the identities of both boys by very early the next morning, and interviewed both Saturday May 12th.  The younger boy&#39;s parents had called authorities without being prompted by any radio broadcast. The older boy was turned in by his teacher, who had seen him unattended, exit a burning Haunted Castle, and alerted police as soon as he could. This boy set numerous fires. Bumping up against the strobe pad could not have accidentally ignited it. Try to reproduce such a thing. It takes about 30 seconds to set fire to polyurethane foam. It is unclear why the prosecutor didn&#39;t go after him.

&#34;&#34;According to news reports of the trial, no such boy was ever found, and no other witness testified to seeing such a boy. Under cross-examination by the defense, the witness denied starting the fire himself.&#34;&#34;

Although its true as it is quote from the article, the identity of the boy was well known to investigators.

I think there should be added also be added mention of the name of the ninth person who lived from the ill-fated group, the legacy of exploitation and disrespect that has been associated with the property, as well as numerous other facts.

Thanks!

Yes, I am saying that 9.000... &gt; 9. This follows from the previous steps in complete agreement with previous assumptions. I will not discuss the  infinitesimal because it is nonsense. There are no infinitesimals in the real numbers or any other numbers. Non-standard numbers are also nonsense. I have illustrated clearly what happens when you treat a &#39;false&#39; assumption as true, you end up with a contradiction. The false assumption here is that 0.999...=1.
It is not possible to find an epsilon = 1-0.999... just as it is impossible for you to completely represent an irrational number. You don&#39;t seem to have a problem with using pi or other irrational numbers as approximations but you have the audacity (or rather foolishness) to make wild claims like the ones in your main article. By definition, 1 &gt; 0.999... There is no duplicate representation. It is your attempt to have this equality that gives rise to duplicate representation. Quite frankly it does not matter that we can&#39;t find an epsilon = 1 - 0.999... because our arithemetic deals only with *finitely represented* quantities or approximations in all other calculations where we cannot completely represent given numbers. So which proof do you want me to illustrate as false next - your &#39;Archimedean-type&#39; proof? 98.195.24.26

We do agree that speculations about Geli are unhelpful for the article, although mentioning her suicide is IMO encyclopedic. However, mentioning wholly unsupported stuff about fetishes and retirements to Antarctica is not encylopedic, since including all the nutty things ever said about Mr Hitler would fill several books and be way detached from reality.

Sorry, my bad. In response to the query you left on my talk page, some specific (but by no means the only) examples which I found problematic are:
&#34;&#34;However, a significantly smaller group of people know the name and person behind the images. The fame and fortune of artists are notoriously mercurial; Grossman&#39;s personal profile is demonstrably due a raise.&#34;&#34;
&#34;&#34;Ceaselessly toiling in the field of illustration since the 1960s, Grossman has amassed an impressive, enormous body of work...&#34;&#34;
&#34;&#34;At a separate website, which may be accessed through his main site, T-shirts bearing Grossman&#39;s designs are available.&#34;&#34;
The first and third of those should probably be removed altogether - it isn&#39;t the purpose of Wikipedia to raise Grossman&#39;s profile, nor to sell his t-shirts. The second could be made more neutral by changing it to:
&#34;&#34;Having worked in the field of illustration since the 1960s, Grossman has amassed an sizeable body of work...&#34;&#34;
Also, several sections of the article (&#34;&#34;Painter&#34;&#34;, &#34;&#34;Sculptor&#34;&#34;, &#34;&#34;These days&#34;&#34;) don&#39;t cite any sources, so things like:
&#34;&#34;surveying four decades of Grossman creations, one finds that &#34;&#34;the awkward, early work&#34;&#34; and the &#34;&#34;tired, later work&#34;&#34; simply don&#39;t exist.&#34;&#34;
have a tendancy to read like your own personal opinions. The article as a whole seems to paint a rosy picture of Grossman, but I don&#39;t see much in the way of critical assessment of his work. I would say in general that you need to be wary of WP:NPOV, WP:NOR and WP:V. Personally, I always find it useful to look at several featured articles to get an idea of the kind of standards I should be aiming for.

That&#39;s just my opinion, of course. ) It might be an idea for you to list the article at Wikipedia:Requests for feedback to get a few comments from other users.  &#34;
